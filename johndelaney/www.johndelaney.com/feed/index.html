<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, the Canadian government announced the creation of a new Advisory Council on Artificial Intelligence. The council includes representatives from the private sector and researchers and is tasked with promoting economic growth and job opportunities and a human-centric approach to machine learning. </p>



<p>John Delaney, the founder of the AI Caucus in Congress, has called for similar efforts from the United States. As part of his platform, Delaney has pushed for the implementation of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">National AI Strategy</a>. Last year, Delaney published an op-ed in <em>Wired </em>titled, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-needs-an-ai-strategy/" target="_blank">France, China and the EU All Have an AI Strategy. Shouldn’t the US?”</a><br><br>“When it comes to artificial intelligence, we can’t fall behind,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong> “We’ve been the global leader in technological innovation, research, and entrepreneurship, but that doesn’t mean we will be at the top forever. Right next door, Canada is taking action. They’re developing AI superclusters and focusing on commercialization. This should be a wake-up call. <br><br>“Our economic competitors around the world recognize the importance of AI and we need to as well. History shows that new technologies create more jobs than they displace, but to make sure that those new jobs are being created here in America, we need a proactive approach. We must make sure we’re investing in research, preparing workers for the future, and developing guidelines on ethics and privacy. The current White House is focused on the past, we need to be focused on the future.” </p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD – </strong>Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“The abortion bans being implemented in Alabama and Georgia are an all-out attack on women and their freedom. Plain and simple. It places control over a woman’s physical body in the hands of the state. These bans are unconstitutional and infringements on a woman’s right to privacy.  Decisions regarding women’s reproductive health should be made by the woman and her doctor, not politicians. Banning legal abortions will not stop abortions, it only stops women from having safe abortions. I will fight for women’s rights every single day and every step of the way.”</p>

<h4><em>Half the Democratic field is just like Trump on trade, protectionists stuck in the 80s</em></h4>



<p style="text-align:left"><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – With President Trump’s protectionist trade policies damaging the country economically, John Delaney asks if the many 2020 Democrats who opposed President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and espoused anti-trade policy regret their past views. By 2:00 PM Eastern, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down over 600 points, following months of economic problems for farmers in the Midwest due to the tariff fight. <br><br>Delaney was one of a small number of House Democrats who voted in favor of giving the Obama Administration Trade Promotion Authority in 2015 and also supported TPP. Trump campaigned against the TPP in 2016 and pulled the US out of the agreement in 2017. Many Democrats took his position. <br><br>“Democratic voters deserve to know if their candidates have an Obama trade policy or a Trump trade policy. Close to half the current field stood on the floor of the US Senate and cast a vote saying they didn’t trust President Obama to negotiate a good trade deal. It’s absurd.<br><br>“Frankly, we’re in the mess we’re in because of an alliance between the far left and the far right that came together to kill the TPP – which would have been an incredible leverage point in negotiating with China. Trump trashed Obama and a lot of Democrats basically went along with it hook, line, and sinker. It killed the deal politically. <br><br>“When it comes to trade, half our field is just like Trump: stuck in the 80s. <br><br>“Here’s what I’d do: get back in the TPP, end the tariff fight, and focus on real problems like IP theft and China’s military aggression in the South China Sea.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – President Trump escalated his trade war with China this morning, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. <strong>Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement</strong>:<br><br>“It is clear that Donald Trump has little to no understanding of how the economy works or what the true risk from China really is. His trade war is hurting rural America and causing a rise in bankruptcies for farmers. We cannot continue down this path.<br><br>“The fact that the President bankrupted his various companies doesn’t mean that we should allow him to bankrupt Americans all across this country. If the President is as great a deal maker as he claims, he should close this deal and allow Iowans to stay in their homes. Instead, the President is overly fixated on the trade deficit &#8211; as opposed to intellectual property theft &#8211; and is abandoning the American worker.”<br> </p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – As trade chaos continues, presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“American workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs are being hurt by President Trump&#8217;s trade war. But here&#8217;s the hard truth about the trade fight with China: Trump isn&#8217;t the only one to blame. Everyone on the far left and the far right who undermined President Obama and the US involvement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is to blame. By enabling Trumponomics, they had us walk away from new markets and from a huge leverage point. We could have set the terms in the region with TPP. Now we&#8217;re playing catchup. It&#8217;s another lesson &#8211; when you put politics over the facts, the country suffers.”</p>

<p><strong>CONTACT:&nbsp;</strong>Carrie Healey, 301-500-8642,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:carrie@johnkdelaney.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carrie@johnkdelaney.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:press@johnkdelaney.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press@johnkdelaney.com</a></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– Today,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;reported on the state of Trump&#8217;s businesses</a>&nbsp;finding that Trump’s businesses lost an estimated $1.17 billion between 1985 to 1994 and avoided paying taxes as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Trump is even less qualified to talk about capitalism than Bernie,”&nbsp;<strong>said John Delaney</strong>.</p>



<p>“Trump&#8217;s economic policies are bankrupting farmers in the Midwest – just like he bankrupted his businesses – and his lack of fiscal discipline will balloon the federal deficit and increase our massive national debt. As a former entrepreneur and CEO who was actually successful, it&#8217;s tough to watch the President masquerade as a mogul. What we really need is someone who understands the economy and what we need to do to grow the middle class. My plan is to embrace free trade, strengthen our safety net, double the Earned Income Tax Credit and dramatically invest in industries of the future, like Negative Emissions Technology.”</p>



<p>John Delaney grew up in a blue-collar union household in northern New Jersey and his parents did not attend college. Delaney is a former entrepreneur and founded and led two-publicly traded companies.</p>



<p>Delaney’s businesses were focused on providing capital to small and medium-sized companies, helping thousands of businesses grow. Delaney is a past winner of Ernst &amp; Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year Award and his business received the Bank Enterprise Award from the Obama Administration for investing in economically distressed communities.</p>



<p>In Congress, John was known for his work crafting innovative bipartisan legislation to rebuild America’s infrastructure. In 2017, Fortune Magazine named Delaney one of the World’s Greatest Leaders for his efforts.</p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney, one of the few 2020 candidates to stand with President Obama and support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), releases the following statement on President Trump’s latest tariff fight with China:</p>



<p>“President Trump is learning the hard way that trade wars aren’t easy to win and America is paying the price. Thanks to his policies, profits are down and bankruptcies are up in the heartland. But if Democrats run on Trump’s trade policies too, we’ll offer voters no alternative and we’ll lose again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Frankly, to beat Trump in rural America you have to have supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The President’s trade war is resulting in unnecessary harm to the American economy &#8211; specifically in places like Iowa. While we should certainly hold China responsible for their bad behavior, the answer to addressing China’s unfair trade practices is not to punish American workers and consumers, the answer is to out-compete them. That’s why Trump’s decision to pull out of the TPP was so disastrous. America’s farmers need new markets, not tweets.</p>



<p>“The President is engaging in reckless political theater and chasing short-term concessions while doing nothing to address the big picture. The right answer is to stop making policy pronouncements via Twitter, engage in honest and responsible diplomacy, and embrace free trade.”</p>



<p>Last week, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/04/30/delaney-calls-for-responsible-strong-and-future-facing-foreign-policy-in-speech-in-washington/" target="_blank">Delaney spoke</a> on China, trade, and foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.   <br></p>
