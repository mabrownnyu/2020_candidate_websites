<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– Tonight, John Delaney&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/climate-change/">highlighted his $4 trillion climate plan</a>, which features a Carbon Fee and Dividend, support for direct air capture and negative emissions technology, increasing the renewable energy research budget by fivefold, challenge grants to promote innovation, a Climate Corps, and a Carbon Throughway.<br><br>While in Congress, Delaney cosponsored the only bipartisan bill to put a price on carbon emissions and has vowed to make it a first priority for his administration.<br><br><strong>Delaney’s remarks are transcribed below and can be&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1144072980378595328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewed here</a>.</strong><br><br>&#8220;All of the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You can’t put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people.</p>



<p>&#8220;My proposal is to put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people. It goes out one pocket, back in the other. I can get that passed my first year as President with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states. The Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue. This has got to be our way forward if we are actually serious about this issue.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h4 style="text-align:center"><strong>John Delaney&#8217;s Plan For Climate Change</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>&nbsp;John Delaney is serious about tackling climate change.&nbsp; It’s a big problem and it requires big solutions, which is why Delaney is announcing his $4 trillion Climate Plan that is full of new ideas and innovative solutions.<br><br>According to the IPCC, limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We are already seeing the early effects of climate change, and that level of rapid emissions reductions is necessary to avoid the catastrophic consequences that would result from any further delay. The difference between the warming we have already experienced and the 2°C warming we could see if we don’t act now to reduce emissions is a greater risk of water scarcity, increased sea-level rise, greater damage to ecosystems and animal habitats, declines in human health, and the displacement of millions of people. In addition to the environmental effects, the Department of Defense has characterized climate change as a threat multiplier. Delaney’s plan will put us on the right track to reduce emissions in time to avoid the worst consequences of global warming.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Carbon Fee and Dividend</strong><br>The largest component of Delaney’s climate plan that will have the biggest impact is his Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal. It is time we put a price on carbon to end polluters’ free ride. While in Congress, Delaney introduced the first bipartisan Carbon Fee and Dividend bill in over 10 years. The proposal starts the fee at $15 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;equivalent and increases the cost by $10 each year. Implementing a carbon fee, where the revenue is returned to the American people, is the best method for providing the market incentives to reduce our emissions. Delaney’s Carbon Fee will reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2050. Taxpayers would also be given options with what to do with the dividend, including investing in a tax-advantaged savings account like a 529 for future education purposes or a retirement account. The Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal has bipartisan support from various industries in the private sector as well as the environmental community. However, we need more innovative solutions that will get us to net-zero emissions by 2050.</li></ol>



<ol><li><strong>Direct Air Capture/Negative Emissions Technology (NET)</strong><br>Reducing new carbon emissions and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not be enough to limit global warming. According to the IPCC, to achieve net zero emissions and prevent warming in excess of 1.5°C we will need Negative Emissions Technology, including direct air capture, to remove a minimum of 100 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;from the atmosphere. This technology is currently too expensive to be implemented at the necessary scale, which is why Delaney proposes ending the federal government’s fossil fuel subsidies and making an annual $5 billion investment in NET.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#8211; Delaney will promote NET, thus bringing down the cost, through a reverse auction program that gives first access to government subsidies to the companies that can capture and store atmospheric carbon for the lowest cost.&nbsp;<br>&#8211; By promoting innovation in NET and implementing the carbon fee, Delaney will create a powerful financial incentive to capture carbon instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. As emitting carbon becomes more expensive due to the increasing carbon fee, it will be more economical to capture the carbon and avoid paying the fee.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increasing Renewable Energy Research Budget 5-Fold</strong><br>We will solve climate change the American way, innovating our way out of the problem. This will require continued robust government support. Delaney proposes a 5-fold increase in DOE green energy programs, including the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and the Office of Nuclear Energy. This investment will support research to improve energy storage, battery performance, sustainable transportation technology, grid efficiency, renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, and energy conservation technology.<br><br>To continue private sector investment in the renewable energy economy, Delaney will bolster renewable energy tax credits.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Challenge Grants</strong><br>To spur climate change innovation in the private and non-profit sectors, Delaney will create a new challenge grant program for significant innovations in:<br>&#8211; Preventing and stopping wildfires<br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from agriculture&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from manufacturing&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Electrification of freight&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Energy storage and transmission<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Climate Corps</strong><br>Delaney proposed the creation of the Climate Corps as part of his National Service Program. The new program would provide opportunities for recent high school graduates to work in low-income urban and rural communities where the Corps members would support these communities’ transition to a green economy, work on environmentally friendly projects, and fight climate change by working on the ground. Under-resourced communities for too long have suffered the most from pollution and climate change, all too often lacking clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. We must provide the manpower and resources to support these communities and recognize that all Americans have a right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment.<br>&nbsp;<br>In partnership with the government, community-based organizations, and local businesses, Climate Corps members can help communities:<br>&#8211; Identify the most pressing local needs that are hindering the community from transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Provide information and support to families about sustainability, energy efficiency, and renewable energy&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Assist in clean energy projects including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Carbon Throughway</strong><br>Climate change skeptics often invoke the false choice of having to choose between jobs or the environment; we can create jobs AND fight climate change at the same time. That’s where the Carbon Throughway comes in.<br><br>The Carbon Throughway is a $20 billion infrastructure project that we will construct to safely transport captured CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to sites for permanent sequestration and reuse. Building the Carbon Throughway will create tens of thousands of jobs and spur new R&amp;D and innovation in carbon capture. The project would be built with federal labor protections using American steel under a project labor agreement and pay workers prevailing wages. To the extent possible, the Throughway will be built along right of ways of existing pipelines and always abide by the strictest environmental standards. As the carbon fee raises the price of releasing emissions and new innovations in NET make carbon capture cost-effective, the Carbon Throughway will provide an additional financial incentive to capture carbon by facilitating its transfer for commercial uses and permanent sequestration.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol>

<p></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; At the first Democratic presidential debate tonight, John Delaney explained his Living Wage Plan. Delaney&#8217;s plan doubles the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program, increases the minimum wage, and established paid family leave.</p>



<p>Delaney also highlighted his entrepreneurial background.&nbsp;In 2010, John Delaney&#8217;s business,&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=de3086d900&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CapitalSource, received the Bank Enterprise Award from the Obama Administration Treasury Department</a>&nbsp;for CapitalSource&#8217;s support of Clearinghouse CDFI and Southern California Reinvestment (SoCal) CDFI.</p>



<p><strong>Delaney&#8217;s remarks are transcribed below:</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I think we need to do real things to help American workers and the American people. This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage, and I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers. Then we have got to fix our public education system. It&#8217;s not delivering the results our kids need, nor is college, and post high school career and technical training programs are doing that. You know, I&#8217;m very different than everyone else here on stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small to mid-sized businesses all over the country. Five-thousand of them I supported. The Obama Administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities. I know how to create jobs. We need a short term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave, and then we need to  have a long term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we are creating jobs everywhere in this country.&#8221;</p>



<p>Delaney&#8217;s full plan can be found online&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=c0dd84b69a&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney’s Living Wage Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Every American worker deserves to earn a living wage. While there has been debate over whether an increase to the minimum wage or an increase of the Earned Income Tax Credit is the right path to increase wages, Delaney believes that the right approach is to increase both.<br><br>Additionally, a true living wage should also account for paid family leave so that workers don’t have to choose between taking leave to care for their newborn or sick loved one and earning enough money to support their family.<br><br>Delaney’s Living Wage proposal includes three new policies:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Creates a New Workers’ Tax Credit</strong><br>Delaney will create a new Workers’ Tax Credit by expanding and nearly doubling the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program. Currently, the EITC’s benefits lift&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=579f4ba2f0&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million adults and nearly 3 million children</a>&nbsp;out of poverty, but these families and others just outside the income thresholds are still struggling to get by. Delaney will provide more support for hardworking families by increasing their tax credits and expanding the program to include more low-income workers.<ol><li>Delaney’s new Workers’ Tax Credit will increase maximum benefits for low-income earners by $1,500 for each eligibility category.</li><li>The new Workers’ Tax Credit would provide much-needed financial assistance to 14 million more households than the current EITC program, an increase of almost 50%.<ol><li>As an example, a single mother of one who earns $20,000 would receive a fully refundable tax credit of more than $5,000.</li></ol></li><li>The Workers’ Tax Credit proposal will be paid for by raising capital gains tax rates on high income earners, repealing the Trump tax cuts for high income earners, and creating a new Robot Tax on job-displacing capital investments.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Minimum Wage Increase</strong><br>No American should still live in poverty if they work full time. Period. The minimum wage has long served as a protection to ensure that workers could make a living, but due to increases to the cost of living, the minimum wage’s inflation-adjusted value has declined by more than 37% since 1968. There have been&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=665e0a2ae9&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no changes to the federal minimum wage since 2009</a>, the longest period in American history without a minimum wage increase. We need to make up for that.<ol><li>Delaney will raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour over time, including for tipped employees, and then index it to inflation.</li><li>Successful recent state-wide ballot initiatives in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, and Washington show widespread bipartisan support for increasing the minimum wage.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Establishes Paid Family Leave</strong><br>The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t provide some form of paid caregiving leave, and it’s time to make a change. Providing guaranteed time off and income replacement will be a major benefit for workers and their families, while funding family leave through the federal government will avoid placing large financial burdens on small businesses.<ol><li>Delaney will establish a new federal paid family leave program, which can be fully paid for with a very small payroll tax increase.<ol><li>Delaney’s plan allows eligible individuals to take up to eight weeks of leave each year, receiving 60% of their monthly wage.</li><li>Workers would be able to take paid leave for a serious health problem; birth and care of a child; placement and care of an adopted child or a child in foster care; or caring for a child, spouse, parent, or domestic partner with a serious health problem.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>



<p><strong>It is impossible to be pro-worker if you’re not pro-business, and it’s impossible to be pro-business if you’re not pro-worker. We have to support both.</strong></p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Tonight, John Delaney highlighted his plan for universal health care,&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=b4a4ee7b9f&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BetterCare</a>, at the first Democratic primary debate. Delaney’s plan provides all Americans a government health care plan for free, but allows people the ability to keep their private or union-provided plans if they desire.</p>



<p>Delaney&#8217;s remarks are transcribed below and can be&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=4dc42d9f7c&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewed here</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;They like their private health insurance by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans …</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we should be the party that&nbsp;keeps what’s working and fixes what&#8217;s broken. I mean doesn&#8217;t that make sense? We should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free. Full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Also its bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates.</p>



<p>&#8220;So to some extent we&#8217;re basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed. I mean my dad was a union electrician, right, I actually grew up in a working-class family, he loved the health care that the IBEW gave him and I just always think about my dad and anything I would do from a policy perspective he’d look at me and he’d say good job John for getting healthcare for every American, but why are you taking my healthcare away.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Michael Starr Hopkins, Delaney’s National Press Secretary releases the following statement:   </strong><br><br>&#8220;If we want to beat Trump in 2020, we can’t do it by embracing socialism or pandering to the loudest voices in the party &#8211; who incorrectly believe that Medicare-for-all is the best path forward. We’ll do it by offering better ideas that improve the lives of all Americans. We must clear about what’s at stake in this election. The cost of doing nothing won’t be nothing, the cost of doing nothing will be the re-election of Donald J. Trump.&#8221;<br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=e4c9b55235&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">Recent polling by Navigator Research</a> on single-payer Medicare for All again reveals that 53% of respondents are opposed to a Medicare for All program that eliminates private insurance. Section 107 of the single-payer Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders (and cosponsored by Senator Harris, Senator Warren, and others) states that private insurance for any benefits covered by Medicare is illegal. </p>

<p><br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Today, the <em>Washington Post </em>reported that “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/voters-have-big-health-care-worries-but-not-the-ones-democrats-are-talking-about/2019/06/21/5c4a353e-8d22-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html?utm_term=.339d302b4455">Voters have big health-care worries, but not the ones Democrats are talking about</a>.” Instead of Medicare for All, the Post reports that “many voters are not focused on such lofty goals. They want something simpler — to pay less for their own health care.”<br><br>Earlier this year, John Delaney released his plan to <a href="http://live-delaney.pantheonsite.io/issues/prescription-drugs/">lower prescription drug prices</a>. Delaney’s plan will lower prescription drug costs through a 100% excise tax on the difference between the cost charged in the United States and the average cost in the developed world.

This report from the Post, as well as other recent polling, makes it clear that voters don’t want single-payer and aren’t interested in a podcast-style philosophical debate about health care – they want something that works.

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, presidential candidate John Delaney joined <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/delaney-democrats-need-to-focus-on-what-matters-to-americans-62503493726">MSNBC</a> after his speech at the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention to talk about infrastructure, the upcoming DNC debate, and the right path toward universal health care.<br><br>“So, I’m running on real solutions, not impossible promises,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong> “I think, respectfully, some of the people I’m running against are running on some impossible promises, and I think that at the end of the day, if we go to the general election running on some of these things, we’re not going to win.”<br><br>“You know, Medicare for All is a good example,” <strong>Delaney continued.</strong> “I want every American to have health care – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://live-delaney.pantheonsite.io/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">I have a plan</a> that gives every American basic health care as a right, for free. But I don’t make private insurance illegal. I mean, does anyone really think we’re going to win the general election if we go out and tell the American people that 150 million of you that have private insurance – and a lot of them like it – that we, the Democratic party are going to make that illegal? These are the types of things I’m talking about, which is, let’s do some common sense things, let’s stand for the politics of addition.”<br><br>Delaney’s full speech at the convention can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp8Kf2cX1vo&amp;feature=youtu.be">viewed here</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp8Kf2cX1vo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">.</a><br></p>

<p><strong>COLUMBIA, SC </strong>– This evening, John Delaney discussed his blue-collar roots and called for Democrats to put workers at the center of their efforts in 2020. Earlier today, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://live-delaney.pantheonsite.io/issues/living-wage/" target="_blank">Delaney released his Living Wage Plan</a>, which includes doubling the Earned Income Tax Credit, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and creating universal paid family leave. <br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1142262809633460224" target="_blank">Delaney’s remarks are available on video here</a> and transcribed below:<br><br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Remarks at Clyburn Fish Fry</strong></p>



<p>Thank you, Jim Clyburn! Let’s hear it for Jim! The incomparable, the extraordinary, the one of a kind Jim Clyburn. Thank you, South Carolina!<br><br>I tell you, the one thing that always struck me about Jim, so I grew up in a working-class family, my dad was an electrician, he was a union electrician. And we didn’t have any fancy conversations around the dinner table about politics. But what he would tell me, all the time, “If you care about workers, you vote for the Democrats!” And I tell you, if we get can back to that lesson, we’re going to win every election. And Jim Clyburn doesn’t let anyone forget about that lesson in the Congress of the United States. <br><br>My friends, together we are on a mission. A mission to find the America that has been lost. Lost through inaction, lost through incivility, lost through a President that lacks a moral compass. We are better than this. Every one of us is better than this. As a country, we are a country of faith, of goodness, of strength and ambition. We saved the world. We created the American Dream for millions of people, including people like myself, who grew up in a blue-collar family, had a successful career in business, and then had the privilege to serve my country. <br><br>But we did it with real solutions, not impossible promises. And we gotta do that again. Whether it’s fixing health care, improving public education, building infrastructure, or creating jobs. We got to do it with real solutions and put the worker at the center of those solutions. That’s what I promise to do as your president. I’ve done it my whole life. <br><br>I don’t want to just be your president, I want to do the job.  God bless you all. Thank you, Jim Clyburn, thank you South Carolina, and thank you for soon sending Jamie Harrison to the Senate of the United States of America.</p>

<h4><em>Plan paid for by raising capital gains tax, new tax on job displacing robots</em></h4>



<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney releases today his three-part Living Wage Plan, a comprehensive plan to boost take home pay and establish universal paid family leave.<br></p>



<p>Delaney’s plan 1) creates a new <strong>Workers’ Tax Credit </strong>which nearly double the existing Earned Income Tax Credit, increasing the maximum benefits for recipients in each category by $1,500; 2) <strong>raises the Minimum Wage to $15</strong> and indexes to inflation and; 3) establishes a <strong>universal Paid Family Leave program </strong>of eight weeks. Delaney’s plans are paid for by raising the capital gains rate on high-income earners, rolling back the Trump tax cuts on high-income earners and creating a new Robot Tax, a tax on job-displacing capital investments.<br></p>



<p>“My Living Wage plan gives tens of millions of Americans higher pay, lower taxes, and better benefits. It’s time to give those that work some of the toughest jobs in America a raise. My new Workers’ Tax Credit expands a bipartisan program, the EITC, that we know works and pairs it with a $15 minimum wage and universal paid family leave, which would really make a difference for working families,” <strong>said John Delaney. </strong>“My plan is fiscally responsible and it’s fair, we can pay for this by rolling back the GOP tax cuts on high-income earners, adjusting the capital gains tax rates with proposals similar to the Buffett Rule, and by taxing robots and machines that displace workers and don’t contribute to the social safety net.  This is what it looks like when we craft policies that are focused on workers.”<br><br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney’s Living Wage Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Every American worker deserves to earn a living wage. While there has been debate over whether an increase to the minimum wage or an increase of the Earned Income Tax Credit is the right path to increase wages, Delaney believes that the right approach is to increase both.<br><br>Additionally, a true living wage should also account for paid family leave so that workers don’t have to choose between taking leave to care for their newborn or sick loved one and earning enough money to support their family.<br><br>Delaney’s Living Wage proposal includes three new policies:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Creates a New Workers’ Tax Credit</strong><br>Delaney will create a new Workers’ Tax Credit by expanding and nearly doubling the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program. Currently, the EITC’s benefits lift&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-earned-income-tax-credit">2.8 million adults and nearly 3 million children</a>&nbsp;out of poverty, but these families and others just outside the income thresholds are still struggling to get by. Delaney will provide more support for hardworking families by increasing their tax credits and expanding the program to include more low-income workers.<ol><li>Delaney’s new Workers’ Tax Credit will increase maximum benefits for low-income earners by $1,500 for each eligibility category.</li><li>The new Workers’ Tax Credit would provide much-needed financial assistance to 14 million more households than the current EITC program, an increase of almost 50%.<ol><li>As an example, a single mother of one who earns $20,000 would receive a fully refundable tax credit of more than $5,000.</li></ol></li><li>The Workers’ Tax Credit proposal will be paid for by raising capital gains tax rates on high income earners, repealing the Trump tax cuts for high income earners, and creating a new Robot Tax on job-displacing capital investments.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Minimum Wage Increase</strong><br>No American should still live in poverty if they work full time. Period. The minimum wage has long served as a protection to ensure that workers could make a living, but due to increases to the cost of living, the minimum wage’s inflation-adjusted value has declined by more than 37% since 1968. There have been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/business/us-minimum-wage-by-year/index.html">no changes to the federal minimum wage since 2009</a>, the longest period in American history without a minimum wage increase. We need to make up for that.<ol><li>Delaney will raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour over time, including for tipped employees, and then index it to inflation.</li><li>Successful recent state-wide ballot initiatives in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, and Washington show widespread bipartisan support for increasing the minimum wage.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Establishes Paid Family Leave</strong><br>The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t provide some form of paid caregiving leave, and it’s time to make a change. Providing guaranteed time off and income replacement will be a major benefit for workers and their families, while funding family leave through the federal government will avoid placing large financial burdens on small businesses.<ol><li>Delaney will establish a new federal paid family leave program, which can be fully paid for with a very small payroll tax increase.<ol><li>Delaney’s plan allows eligible individuals to take up to eight weeks of leave each year, receiving 60% of their monthly wage.</li><li>Workers would be able to take paid leave for a serious health problem; birth and care of a child; placement and care of an adopted child or a child in foster care; or caring for a child, spouse, parent, or domestic partner with a serious health problem.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>



<p><strong>It is impossible to be pro-worker if you’re not pro-business, and it’s impossible to be pro-business if you’re not pro-worker. We have to support both.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“Withdrawing from the Iran agreement, alienating our allies, and ramping up the pressure on Iran without a clear strategy has created an inherently dangerous situation in the region and is a foreign policy failure by the Trump administration.  Make no mistake about it, Iran is a horrible actor &#8211; they sponsor terror, undermine the interest of the U.S. and our allies, and work to actively destabilize the Middle East.  If they shot down a U.S. asset over international territory, they must be held accountable.   <br><br>“We need a President with a strong and stable hand and strategic approach; we should not contribute mindlessly to conditions which could spark a crisis, put the extraordinary men and women of the U.S. military at risk, and undermine the interests of the citizens of the United States.”<br> </p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>Ahead of President Trump&#8217;s re-election campaign launch,&nbsp;John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>&#8220;What we will see and hear from the President in Orlando tonight is more of the same; empty promises, fear mongering, and lies. Thankfully, Democrats have a chance to beat him and his corrupt Administration where it counts most, at the ballot box on Election Day.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>&#8220;Republicans are already stepping over each other to label the Democratic Party as the party of socialism, impossible promises or indifferent to the struggles facing hardworking Americans.&nbsp; We should not give them that opportunity.&nbsp;</strong>We should not make this election about&nbsp;socialism or throwing out the entire economic model of the United States of America. The best strategy for Democrats to beat Donald Trump is to put forth a nominee who is focused on solving the real problems facing the American people, getting our country working again with big ideas to fix healthcare, building infrastructure, and improving education, and restoring honor and integrity to the Presidency. It is time to turn the page on Trump and the last several decades of broken American politics.&#8221;</p>
