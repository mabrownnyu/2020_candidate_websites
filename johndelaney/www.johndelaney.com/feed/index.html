								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – President Trump escalated his trade war with China this morning, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. <strong>Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement</strong>:<br><br>“It is clear that Donald Trump has little to no understanding of how the economy works or what the true risk from China really is. His trade war is hurting rural America and causing a rise in bankruptcies for farmers. We cannot continue down this path.<br><br>“The fact that the President bankrupted his various companies doesn’t mean that we should allow him to bankrupt Americans all across this country. If the President is as great a deal maker as he claims, he should close this deal and allow Iowans to stay in their homes. Instead, the President is overly fixated on the trade deficit &#8211; as opposed to intellectual property theft &#8211; and is abandoning the American worker.”<br> </p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – As trade chaos continues, presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“American workers, farmers, and entrepreneurs are being hurt by President Trump&#8217;s trade war. But here&#8217;s the hard truth about the trade fight with China: Trump isn&#8217;t the only one to blame. Everyone on the far left and the far right who undermined President Obama and the US involvement in the Trans-Pacific Partnership is to blame. By enabling Trumponomics, they had us walk away from new markets and from a huge leverage point. We could have set the terms in the region with TPP. Now we&#8217;re playing catchup. It&#8217;s another lesson &#8211; when you put politics over the facts, the country suffers.”</p>

<p><strong>CONTACT:&nbsp;</strong>Carrie Healey, 301-500-8642,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:carrie@johnkdelaney.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carrie@johnkdelaney.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:press@johnkdelaney.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press@johnkdelaney.com</a></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– Today,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;reported on the state of Trump&#8217;s businesses</a>&nbsp;finding that Trump’s businesses lost an estimated $1.17 billion between 1985 to 1994 and avoided paying taxes as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Trump is even less qualified to talk about capitalism than Bernie,”&nbsp;<strong>said John Delaney</strong>.</p>



<p>“Trump&#8217;s economic policies are bankrupting farmers in the Midwest – just like he bankrupted his businesses – and his lack of fiscal discipline will balloon the federal deficit and increase our massive national debt. As a former entrepreneur and CEO who was actually successful, it&#8217;s tough to watch the President masquerade as a mogul. What we really need is someone who understands the economy and what we need to do to grow the middle class. My plan is to embrace free trade, strengthen our safety net, double the Earned Income Tax Credit and dramatically invest in industries of the future, like Negative Emissions Technology.”</p>



<p>John Delaney grew up in a blue-collar union household in northern New Jersey and his parents did not attend college. Delaney is a former entrepreneur and founded and led two-publicly traded companies.</p>



<p>Delaney’s businesses were focused on providing capital to small and medium-sized companies, helping thousands of businesses grow. Delaney is a past winner of Ernst &amp; Young’s Entrepreneur of the Year Award and his business received the Bank Enterprise Award from the Obama Administration for investing in economically distressed communities.</p>



<p>In Congress, John was known for his work crafting innovative bipartisan legislation to rebuild America’s infrastructure. In 2017, Fortune Magazine named Delaney one of the World’s Greatest Leaders for his efforts.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney, one of the few 2020 candidates to stand with President Obama and support the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), releases the following statement on President Trump’s latest tariff fight with China:</p>



<p>“President Trump is learning the hard way that trade wars aren’t easy to win and America is paying the price. Thanks to his policies, profits are down and bankruptcies are up in the heartland. But if Democrats run on Trump’s trade policies too, we’ll offer voters no alternative and we’ll lose again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Frankly, to beat Trump in rural America you have to have supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The President’s trade war is resulting in unnecessary harm to the American economy &#8211; specifically in places like Iowa. While we should certainly hold China responsible for their bad behavior, the answer to addressing China’s unfair trade practices is not to punish American workers and consumers, the answer is to out-compete them. That’s why Trump’s decision to pull out of the TPP was so disastrous. America’s farmers need new markets, not tweets.</p>



<p>“The President is engaging in reckless political theater and chasing short-term concessions while doing nothing to address the big picture. The right answer is to stop making policy pronouncements via Twitter, engage in honest and responsible diplomacy, and embrace free trade.”</p>



<p>Last week, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/04/30/delaney-calls-for-responsible-strong-and-future-facing-foreign-policy-in-speech-in-washington/" target="_blank">Delaney spoke</a> on China, trade, and foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies.   <br></p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement regarding Stephen Moore’s nomination to the Federal Reserve Board:<br><br>“Stephen Moore is unfit to serve on the Federal Reserve Board. His comments regarding women and people of color are intolerant and disqualifying.  <br><br>“As an economist, Moore has a record of errors and misstatements and he has been a spokesperson for right-wing economic ideology that is not grounded in sound economic policy. The White House should withdraw Moore’s nomination immediately.”<br></p>

<p> <em>“ The cost of doing nothing is not nothing, the cost of doing nothing in mental health is despair, depression, anxiety, addiction, and lives.”</em> <br> </p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>Yesterday, presidential candidate and former Congressman, John Delaney, released&nbsp;his plan&nbsp;to address our current mental health crisis. Delaney’s mental health plan aims to increase access to mental health treatment for every single American.<br><br>“We are in the midst of a mental health crisis. Communities and families across America are devastated by the effects of a prolonged failure to address our broken mental health system; it is a theme that consistently comes up as I travel the country. &nbsp;We cannot continue to have inadequate access to mental health care and expect this issue to solve itself. We must act now,”&nbsp;<strong>said Delaney.</strong><br><br>“The cost of doing nothing is not nothing, the cost of doing nothing in mental health is despair, depression, anxiety, addiction, and lives. Under a Delaney administration, we will act with a thoughtful but swift approach.”&nbsp;<br><br>To read&nbsp;<em>The Des Moines Register’s</em>&nbsp;coverage of Delaney’s mental health plan,&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=c77e203c3d&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">click here</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Mental Health Platform:</h4>



<p>&nbsp;<br>1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience a mental health illness in any given year yet nearly 60% don’t receive mental health services. Not receiving proper treatment for mental health can negatively affect many other aspects of one’s life, including economic stability. Approximately $<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=a6d848bf03&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">193 billion in earnings</a>&nbsp;is lost every year due to serious mental illnesses.The U.S. has not properly emphasized the need to treat our mental health needs as compared with our physical health needs.<br>&nbsp;<br>In Congress, Delaney was on the front lines in defending the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was an important first step in expanding access to mental health treatment for millions of Americans. Delaney voted dozens of times against partisan efforts to repeal the ACA. In 2018, Delaney introduced the Suicide Prevention Analytics Act which aims to address the gap in data reporting as it relates to self-harm and suicidal behavior. This bipartisan bill creates a pilot program to help improve the compilation and sharing of near real-time suicidal behavior information among care providers, prevention experts, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.<br>&nbsp;<br>To address the inadequacy of our mental health record as a country, Delaney proposes to:</p>



<ul><li>Require and enforce mental health parity within the health care system to ensure that individuals who need mental and behavioral health services have the same coverage and access as those who need physical health services.<ul><li>&nbsp;Delaney has made mental health parity a critical component of his<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=042eebc896&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">universal health care plan</a>&nbsp;to ensure everyone’s health care plans provides the necessary coverage to receive care.</li></ul></li><li>Expand access to mental health resources for at-risk populations.<ul><li>Increase the number of mental health professionals in schools to provide services to students, emphasizing early detection and intervention. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness,<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=4650b07d16&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over one-third of students with a mental health condition drop out</a>, the highest dropout rate of any disability group.</li><li>Increase mental health professionals available to those incarcerated in correctional facilities.&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=4039dd3a07&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">64% of those in local jails have experienced symptoms of a mental health condition</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Expand mental and behavioral telehealth options. This is particularly important in rural and underserved communities.<ul><li>&nbsp;Invest in rural broadband to boost telehealth effectiveness.</li></ul></li><li>Increase Medicaid reimbursements rates.<ul><li>Increasing reimbursement rates will help to build provider networks and expand access to mental health professionals for low-income population</li></ul></li></ul>

<p><strong>CONTACT:&nbsp;</strong>Carrie Healey, 301-500-8642,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:carrie@johnkdelaney.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carrie@johnkdelaney.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="mailto:press@johnkdelaney.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press@johnkdelaney.com</a></p>



<p><strong>WEST BURLINGTON, IA</strong>&nbsp;– On Wednesday, John Delaney toured the Big River Resources Ethanol Plant and took part in a roundtable discussion with former Lieutenant Governor Patty Judge, plant COO Jim Leiting and former Iowa State Senator Tom Courtney in West Burlington.</p>



<p>Delaney has spoken out against the Trump Administration’s EPA efforts to undermine the Renewable Fuel Standard by granting waivers exempting small refineries.</p>



<p>“The Renewable Fuel Standard has been good for America and good for Iowa. I think we need to be doing more to boost biofuels, not less. The Trump Administration’s misguided approach on waivers is hurting Iowa. Along with what they’ve done on trade, it’s really a double whammy,” said Delaney.</p>



<p>In March, Delaney released his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/heartland-fair-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartland Fair Deal</a>&nbsp;plan, a comprehensive plan to jumpstart rural America.</p>
