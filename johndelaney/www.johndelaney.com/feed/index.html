<p style="text-align:center"><br><em>“Working together, we can put an end to the opioid epidemic.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– Today, John Delaney releases his Opioid Epidemic Plan, a comprehensive set of policies to address the nation’s opioid addiction crisis. Delaney’s plan addresses the scope of the ongoing epidemic and supports policies to prevent new cases of addiction. The plan includes:<br>&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Strengthening Prevention Efforts</li><li>Ensuring Access to Evidence-Based Substance Use Disorder Treatment</li><li>Invest in Recovery</li><li>Funding for programs</li></ol>



<p>“Opioid addiction is ravaging our nation, which is why I am announcing a new, expansive national plan to address the opioid crisis head-on by strengthening prevention efforts, investing in mental health care, supporting evidence-based treatment programs, and driving economic development,&nbsp;<strong>said John Delaney</strong>.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>“Working together, we can put an end to the opioid epidemic.</strong>&nbsp;We won’t get there overnight or over the next year, but by creating a stronger mental health system, strengthening prevention efforts, and helping those with addiction to rebuild their lives, we can stop the crisis which has hurt millions of American families.”<br><br><strong>Combating the Opioid Epidemic:</strong><br><br>In 2017, more than 47,000 people in the United States died from a drug overdose involving an opioid. That’s an average of 130 people dying every day.&nbsp;<br>Opioids, used improperly or for an excessive amount of time, are dangerous drugs that are a threat to public health. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisors, the&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=801b7c6fd3&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opioid epidemic cost our economy $504 billion dollars in 2015 – 2.8% of GDP.</a>&nbsp;This includes increased healthcare costs, increased criminal justice costs, decreased productivity, and – most importantly – the loss of human life.<br>The costs are staggering.&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=4224905ee4&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A recent study</a>&nbsp;found that individuals who took non-opioid pain medications over the course of 12 months for chronic back, hip, or knee pain had similar pain-related function compared to those on opioid medications, but reported significantly less pain intensity and had fewer adverse medication-related symptoms.&nbsp;<br>As president, Delaney would implement policies to not only address the scope of the ongoing epidemic, but support policies to prevent new cases of addiction.&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Strengthen Prevention Efforts&nbsp;<ul><li>Require physicians who prescribe opioids for longer than 3 days to have the patient sign a disclosure that clearly explains the addictive nature of opioids and of the potential for addiction the longer the patient takes the opioid. Education can be one of the best tools to prevent opioid addiction by ensuring the doctor and the patient have a frank and honest conversation about the drug.</li><li>Require prescriber education on safe opioid prescribing.</li><li>Expand access to alternative pain management options including physical therapy, and non-opioid medication and treatments.<ul><li>Require federal, state, and private payers to cover non-opioid pain treatments without significant copayments or administrative barriers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Continue and expand investment in medical research into non-opioid pain treatments.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Strengthen federal enforcement efforts through DEA, CBP, FDA, etc. to reduce the supply of illicit opioids and the diversion of prescription opioids.</li><li>Hold pharmaceutical executives responsible for their part in fueling the opioid epidemic.</li></ul></li></ul>



<ul><li>Ensure Access to Evidence-Based Substance Use Disorder Treatment<ul><li>Maintain federal funding to states (STR and SOR grants) to build out treatment capacity or help states develop other sustainable funding streams to maintain access, particularly in underserved communities.</li><li>Enforce and expand mental health parity laws.&nbsp;</li><li>Require federal, state, and private payers to cover medication assisted treatment and behavioral health counseling without significant copayments or administrative barriers.&nbsp;</li><li>Invest in workforce development and training for mental healthcare workers.</li><li>Create new and build on existing incentives like the National Health Service Corps to attract medical professionals to underserved communities.&nbsp;</li><li>Expand access to evidence-based substance use disorder treatment in the criminal justice system.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Strengthen and expand programs to help pregnant and post-partum women get access to treatment as well as programs to provide short- and long-term care to children born with neonatal abstinence syndrome.&nbsp;<ul><li>Expand the use of telemedicine.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Invest in Recovery<ul><li>Invest in programs to help those in recovery stay in recovery through job training and placement services, housing support, and other social services that help people rebuild their lives.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Funding for programs<ul><li>Create a new block grant for states that would be funded by implementing a 2 cent tax on morphine milligram equivalents in a prescription pain pill.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><br><strong>MIAMI, FL</strong> – Over two nights in Miami, the Democratic primary had its first extended policy debate on health care. The terms of the debate this weekend make it clear Medicare for All is finally being examined as a policy for the first time ever. <br><br><strong>John Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“A month ago, I was nearly booed off the stage at the California Democratic Party Convention for telling the truth about Medicare for All. I was told to drop out of the race by a sitting member of Congress. And I’m running on a universal health care plan! <br><br>“But we kept speaking out. It may have blown up our Twitter mentions but it also changed the debate in a very good way. Candidates are being forced to explain whether or not they want to eliminate private insurance. The health care debate is now happening on our terms. That wasn’t the case a month ago. On health care, this primary is moving away from platitudes and slogans and moving towards real solutions.”<br> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><strong>MIAMI, FL – </strong>Following Senator Sanders’ discussion of Medicare for All at tonight’s  debate, <strong>John Delaney’s National Press Secretary, Michael Starr Hopkins</strong>, releases the following statement:<br><br>“Senator Senators was wrong about socialism when he endorsed it on his honeymoon in Moscow, he was wrong about socialism when endorsed it in the 80’s and 90’s and ran as an independent, and he’s wrong about it today as a presidential candidate. If Senator Sanders wants to run as a Socialist, he shouldn’t use the Democratic Party as his vessel to re-elect Donald Trump.<br><br>“Socialist approaches to medicine aren’t just bad policy, they’re political disasters. Making private insurance illegal will all but ensure the re-election of Donald Trump.” <br></p>



<p><strong>At last night’s debate, Delaney highlighted his universal health care plan,&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=8a81b3ec7a&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BetterCare</a>, which gives all Americans health insurance as a basic human right but preserves private options. Delaney’s answer is transcribed below and can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=ba2e632d97&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">online here.</a>&nbsp;</strong><br><br>“They like their private health insurance by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans …</p>



<p>“I think we should be the party that&nbsp;keeps what’s working and fixes what&#8217;s broken. I mean doesn&#8217;t that make sense? We should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free. Full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Also its bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates.</p>



<p>“So to some extent we&#8217;re basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed. I mean my dad was a union electrician, right, I actually grew up in a working-class family, he loved the health care that the IBEW gave him and I just always think about my dad and anything I would do from a policy perspective he’d look at me and he’d say good job John for getting healthcare for every American, but why are you taking my healthcare away.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Last night at the first Democratic primary debate, John Delaney highlighted the need for a universal health care system that preserves private insurance options, unlike the current Medicare-for-All bill in the Senate. On “The View” this morning, co-host Sunny Hostin agreed, saying “I think I’m in Delaney’s camp which is, if you enjoy your private insurance and you can afford it and you like it, why can’t you keep that? But those that can’t afford it, why can’t then those people have Medicare?  Why can’t you have both options? If it isn’t broken, then leave it alone, don’t fix that, but fix the broken parts.”<br><br>The clip can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=cacaa3a545&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank">viewed online here</a>.<br><br><strong>At last night’s debate, Delaney highlighted his universal health care plan, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=2d92a22492&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank">BetterCare</a>, which gives all Americans health insurance as a basic human right but preserves private options.

<p><br><strong>MIAMI, FL – </strong>Today, John Delaney joined MSNBC’s Ali Velsli and Stephanie Ruhle for an in-depth discussion about the different paths to achieving universal health care. Delaney’s plan, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=ae01c5a5b4&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank">BetterCare</a>, gives all Americans health insurance as a basic human right while preserving private insurance options.<br><br><strong>Delaney said,</strong> “I just said it, [Elizabeth Warren] outsourced her plan to Senator Sanders. And that’s a huge problem. He is not even a Democrat.”<br><br>Delaney highlighted the problems with eliminating private insurance, including the increased likelihood of hospitals closing. “I travel around this country and I go to rural America quite a bit and we have a crisis in health care in rural America,” <strong>Delaney stressed.</strong> “And there’s not one rural hospital in this country that would stay open if we had Medicare for All based on the way it’s described in that bill. They would all close. They are all just on the edge. Medicare rates as the gentleman just said are half of the rates of private insurance. About a third of their patients are private insurance. So if you cut the reimbursement rates of a third of their patients by half and they’re running barely breaking even, they would close. It’s just something that no one talks about.”<br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=c1b649b5ef&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank">Recent polling by Navigator Research</a> on single-payer Medicare for All again reveals that 53% of respondents are opposed to a Medicare for All program that eliminates private insurance. Section 107 of the single-payer Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders (and cosponsored by Senator Harris, Senator Warren, and others) states that private insurance for any benefits covered by Medicare is illegal. <br><br><br><strong>The full exchange is transcribed below and can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=33dfac2862&amp;e=ec9b49a633" target="_blank">viewed online here</a>.</strong><br><br>Ali Velshi>> And as we just said, 2020 contender and former Congressman, John Delaney joins us right now. You seemed to like that response from Larry.<br><br>John Delaney>> I think he’s saying the truth. I mean, I travel around this country and I go to rural America quite a bit and we have a crisis in health care in rural America. And there’s not one rural hospital in this country that would stay open if we had Medicare for All based on the way it’s described in that bill. They would all close. They are all just on the edge. Medicare rates as the gentleman just said are half of the rates of private insurance. About a third of their patients are private insurance. So if you cut the reimbursement rates of a third of their patients by half and they’re running barely breaking even, they would close. It’s just something that no one talks about.<br><br>Stephanie Ruhle>> So hospitals would close, but what about all the people out there who are on private insurance and are okay with it, people in park ridge, New Jersey, and Villanova, Pennsylvania, how are they going to react when we say — when the government says, you know what, all government funded, no more private insurance?<br><br>Delaney>> We will lose the election by 10 points because it will never happen. If you go to most Americans health care is their number one issue, like our seniors, the gentleman from Kaiser talked about Medicare Advantage. That is private insurance. Half of our seniors are selecting it. Imagine how we’re going to do in the 2020 election if we go out to the seniors in this country and say Medicare Advantage, which you’ve selected and obviously like and they are selecting it in huge numbers, it’s now illegal. None will vote for the Democrats, why would they? It’s the most important thing in their life.<br><br>Ruhle>> I want to say this in the most respectful way possible. How do you get this message across and get it to stick? I think about the Republican debates a few years ago and people who came prepared, who did homework, who had very good reputations, who operated within the lines —<br><br>Velshi>> We are in the wilderness now.<br><br>Ruhle>> — Which you did last night are people like John Kasich, and Jeb Bush, and President Trump decimated them.<br><br>Delaney>> Right.<br><br>Ruhle>> How are you going to make yourself stand out? While people would say you didn’t win or lose last night, some could say it wasn’t a night of impact for you.<br><br>Delaney>> Well, on health care it was. Right? I think on health care it was. This is the number one issue. You travel all around this country, you know this, Stephanie, the things most Americans care about is what’s going on with their health care, it’s the number one issue. We are following someone on this issue — I mean, a bunch of the people on the stage with me, Senator Warren, she outsourced her health care plan to Senator Sanders basically.<br><br>Ruhle>>  Why didn’t you take that shot last night?<br><br>Delaney>> I did. I mean, I was talking about it. You know, this is the problem we have, right? They are all just following this person, he is a he not even a Democrat, I mean, when I —<br><br>Ruhle>> Why are you saying this person.<br><br>Delaney>> Senator Sanders.<br><br>Ruhle>> So say it.<br><br>Delaney>> Well, I, ok, I just said it, she outsourced her plan to Senator Sanders. And that’s a huge problem. He is not even a Democrat. When I first announced I was running for president, everyone said you have to be on the Medicare for All —<br><br>Velshi>> That’s a nonstarter, I’m a Canadian and I believe that Senator Sanders’ plan is the best one to bring our costs down because it’s what most other developed countries have.<br><br>Delaney>> No, it’s not —<br><br>Velshi>> It is.<br><br>Delaney>> No, it’s not. Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, they have mixed models.<br><br>Velshi>> They are universal health care models.<br><br>Delaney>> I’m calling for universal health care, too. To give every American health care as a basic human right. But why do we also have to say you lose your option.<br><br>Velshi>>A Canadian hospital, a U.K. hospital, A French hospital, and a Swiss hospital do not get different rates based on the way in which a person is insured. So your argument about rates is an interesting argument and Larry suggests it’s right, but the idea that you’re pinning that on weirdness on Bernie Sanders, I’m just telling you 54 other countries have it. Every other company OECD country has some form of universality in which everybody’s rates are paid at the same level. So that argument doesn’t make sense.<br><br>Delaney>> I’m sorry, but you are wrong about that. They have universal health care but they don’t have a single-payer system.Right? So- Medicare for All is a single-payer system.<br><br>Velshi>> No it’s not.<br><br>Delaney>> Yes, it is.<br><br>Velshi>> It’s not. It’s an insurance system.<br><br>Delaney>> Medicare for All is not an insurance system.<br><br>Velshi>> It is an insurance system. It’s a payment that reimburses something that’s charged. That’s not how single payer system works. That’s not a single payer system works, that’s not how the UK works or the how the Canadian system works.<br><br>Delaney>> Medicare for All is a single payer bill—I know what Medicare is — do you know what Medicare Advantage is?<br><br>Velshi>> Yes.<br><br>Delaney>> What is Medicare Advantage?<br><br>Velshi>> It is a program that is over and above the basic costs of Medicare that most people get <br>because Medicare doesn’t pay the full costs.<br><br>Delaney>> It’s actually not more expensive. You get it for the same price and —<br><br>Velshi>> It’s —<br><br>JDelaney>> No, this is important. Medicare Advantage, if you and I were turning 65 we could choose Medicare Advantage. Doesn’t cost us anything else. We get more benefits.<br><br>Velshi>> Right, but it’s a higher cost program.<br><br>Delaney>> We have lower copays—No, it’s not.<br><br>Velshi>> It’s not higher cost to you but the cost of the program is— is higher.<br><br>Delaney>> It’s not. The government pays Medicare Advantage providers the same rates they pay Medicare.<br><br>Velshi>> Who pays the extra cost? If you’re getting more out of Medicare Advantage than you are out of Medicare, then where does the extra cost come from?<br><br>Delaney>> They run it more efficiently.<br><br>Velshi>> Because?<br><br>Delaney>> Because they have networks and they manage the care.<br><br>Velshi>> Right. That’s what a larger system, a universal system does.<br><br>Delaney>> But Medicare doesn’t do that right now.<br><br>Velshi>> Right. That’s why Bernie Sanders is calling for Medicare for All so that everything is networked.<br><br>Delaney>> What you just said about Medicare Advantage is not true. Right? Medicare Advantage is an option that our seniors get, they don’t pay anything more for it.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; I understand, John, but whether the senior pays for it, the insurance system pays for it, the government pays for it, or your private insurance pays for it, there are higher costs and lower costs, right? So when I say something costs more and you say it doesn’t cost the user more, it costs the system more. So the United States pays more than double what all industrialized countries pay for health care, that’s a cost that might be borne by you, it might be borne by your insurance company —</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; But there’s a reason for it. If you need a specialist in the UK, it’s not emergency care. Right, you’ve got to wait about nine months.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; That’s just not true.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; It is, too, true. I just had a friend of mine who had a hip replacement in the UK that had to wait nine months.</p>



<p>Ruhle&gt;&gt; Okay. Come on. Come on.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; I just&#8211; I just think you have to have your facts right. Medicare for All&#8211;</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; Listen, my facts are 100% right, the gentleman from Kaiser just confirmed it. Medicare doesn’t pay the cost of health care. That’s a fact. Private insurance pays twice what Medicare does for hospitals. If every hospital were reimbursed at the Medicare rate they would close. So what’s your answer to that? What’s your answer to that?<br><br>Velshi&gt;&gt;No, I&#8211;<br><br>Delaney&gt;&gt; Where does that&#8211; No, but what’s your answer to that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; My argument is that—</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; You’re basically arguing that hospitals should close.&nbsp;<br><br>Velshi&gt;&gt; Uh, I’m not arguing that.&nbsp;<br><br>Delaney&gt;&gt;This is Economics, you are an economist. You have to understand —</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; You’re making my words for me, that’s fine. I’m not making that argument at all.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; What’s your argument to 150 million Americans who are going to lose their health care.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; Why would you lose your health care under a Medicare for All program?</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; Because it makes it illegal.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; Okay I’m not going to —</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; Here is an example, what if this new Medicare for All program doesn’t reimburse —</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; The “for all” part means everybody gets it. There are 11 basic health benefits, guaranteed health benefits that were there under ObamaCare. I’m not arguing it’s a better deal, I’m telling you your argument that people are losing health care under it is incorrect.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; It is correct.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; It’s just not correct. The “for all” part means for all.</p>



<p>Ruhle&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you know what —</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; But it’s your choice. How do you know the Medicare for All benefits will be the same? Again, my dad the union electrician he loved his health care that he got through the IBEW. If my dad were alive and I were to say you have to get off that IBEW and trust me we will have this great new government plan, he would be like let me see it first.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; I hear why people would be frustrated I’m just saying it’s coverage for all people. It may not be at the level that you’re used to when your insurance company pays twice as much as Medicare. I think that’s understandable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; So then, what are the people who then have —</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; They are not losing their health care.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; I never said they lost their health care.</p>



<p>Ruhle&gt;&gt; But Ali, the point is they would be taking a leap, a risk and do you believe that millions of Americans who currently have health care want to take that risk?</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; I agree that that would be difficult for them, but I think —</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; Do you agree that hospitals closing is a problem? Did you see the “Washington Post” two weeks ago that had a story about what’s going on in rural health care? That people&#8211; these portable clinics come in.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; We covered that story.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; And people go, yeah? That’s what’s happening in rural America right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; That’s not because Medicare for All is there. That’s because they don’t have health care.<br><br>Delaney&gt;&gt; I agree with that, but there’s another problem. We’re aging as a society. So, a hospital’s patient mix is changing. It used to have more commercial insurance payments and higher rates, now they’re getting more Medicare patients at lower rates, that’s causing a lot of hospitals in rural America to close.<br><br>Velshi&gt;&gt; Yeah&#8211;<br><br>Delaney&gt;&gt; And this will accelerate that trend.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; I think we will agree on a lot of these issues, I just wanted to be clear that for Medicare for All means Medicare for All people.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; I never said it didn’t give anyone health care coverage. My plan does, too.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; My mistake, I thought that’s what you said but that’s&#8211;</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; No.<br><br>Velshi&gt;&gt; We are agreed.&nbsp;<br><br>Ruhle&gt;&gt; We’re going to leave it there. Before we go, John, your last point of the night is that you want to make America work again.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; That’s right.</p>



<p>Ruhle&gt;&gt; You didn’t get that point in until the very last moment of the night. Are you frustrated with how the night went? Do you —</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; I would have loved more time, right? I don’t think the way the time was allocated was at all fair. I would have loved more time because I think there’s a lot of —</p>



<p>Ruhle&gt;&gt; Why didn’t you take it? Bill de Blasio did.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; Well I&#8211; I took as much as his. I&#8211;They said I tried to interrupt eight times which was the most of the evening. So, you know, I’m from Jersey so I fought my way in as much as I could.</p>



<p>Velshi&gt;&gt; You get the most tenacious award.</p>



<p>Delaney&gt;&gt; That’s what actually someone just gave me. The person who interrupted the most was me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ruhle>> There you go. <br><br>Velshi>> There’s something.<br><br>Ruhle>> John, thanks so much for joining us. Congressman John Delaney from the state of Maryland, but you know what? He just gave a shout out to Jersey. </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Today, the <em>Wall Street Journal </em>published an op-ed, titled <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-and-john-delaneys-dad-11561649812" target="_blank">“Democrats and John Delaney’s Dad,”</a> praising John Delaney for supporting a universal health care system that allows for private insurance options, unlike the current Medicare-for-All bill in the Senate.<br><br>At last night’s debate, two candidates raised their hands to indicate that they would support making private insurance illegal. Delaney, a candidate with “actual knowledge about the private economy,” responded by saying, “I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken.”<br><br><em>The Journal </em>writes, “Other Democrats might not like to hear it, but Mr. Delaney is doing them a favor. He is warning that Medicare for All is a socialist trap that Donald Trump and Republicans will exploit in the general election if one of the Medicare for All candidates wins the Democratic nomination. Millions of union members like John Delaney’s father have excellent health insurance they would like to keep.”<br><br>The full piece is copied below and can be found <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-and-john-delaneys-dad-11561649812" target="_blank">online here</a>.<br><br><br><strong><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-and-john-delaneys-dad-11561649812" target="_blank">Democrats and John Delaney’s Dad</a></strong><br><em>The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board</em><br>June 27, 2019<br><br>A primary campaign is the fight for a party’s nomination but it also lays the political ground for the general election. On that point, the most important moment of the first presidential debate Wednesday night came when Sen. Elizabeth Warren raised her hand to say she would eliminate private health insurance.<br><br><br>NBC moderator Lester Holt teed up the moment when he asked the 10 candidates who would do away with private insurance. Two raised their hands: Senator Warren and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Ms. Warren went on to explain the savings that would result from eliminating administrative costs, co-pays and steep medical bills, and the Democratic crowd applauded.<br><br>Other candidates chimed in with variations of the “public option” for ObamaCare that failed to pass in 2010, supporting a mix of private and public insurance. But then John Delaney spoke up to break the socialist reverie. Mr. Delaney was an entrepreneur before he was a three-term Maryland Congressman, the only Democrat on the stage who isn’t a lawyer or career politician. In other words, he has actual knowledge about the private economy.<br><br>“A hundred million Americans say they like their private health insurance, by the way,” he said. “I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken.”<br><br>He continued: “And also it’s [Medicare for All] bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates. So to some extent we’re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing.”<br><br>He’s referring to the fact that, to control costs, Medicare reimburses hospitals and doctors at 80% or less of the actual cost, often considerably less in high-cost states like New York. The providers stay in business by making up the losses on other patients who have private insurance. Without private insurance, Medicare would either have to pay more or ration care.<br><br>“I mean my dad was a union electrician, right,” Mr. Delaney continued. “I actually grew up in a working-class family. He loved the health care that the IBEW [union] gave him. And I just always think about my dad in anything that I do from a policy perspective. He’d look at me and he’d say, good job, John, for getting health care for every American. But why are you taking my health care away?”<br><br>Mr. Holt missed a chance to ask Ms. Warren to respond, but he ought to take the point up with Bernie Sanders on Thursday evening. Ms. Warren has signed on to Bernie’s Medicare for All bill that would also eliminate private health insurance.<br><br>Other Democrats might not like to hear it, but Mr. Delaney is doing them a favor. He is warning that Medicare for All is a socialist trap that Donald Trump and Republicans will exploit in the general election if one of the Medicare for All candidates wins the Democratic nomination. Millions of union members like John Delaney’s father have excellent health insurance they would like to keep.<br> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br><br><strong>MIAMI, FL</strong> – Ahead of the second night of the Democratic primary debates, presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:<br><br>“Senator Sanders’ Medicare-for-All plan is a disaster for the Democratic Party. It proposes to force over 150 millions of Americans off of their health insurance and will therefore ultimately lead to the re-election of Donald Trump. But Senator Sanders is not alone in his support for this, nearly half the Democratic field has as well, including <strong>Senator Warren &#8211; who has a plan for everything &#8211; but has outsourced health care to someone who isn’t even a Democrat.</strong><br><br>“<strong>We should not allow Senator Sanders to hijack the Democratic Party and use it as a vessel for his socialist agenda</strong>. Capitalism is the greatest job creation and innovation machine ever, and we should be reforming it, not throwing it out.  I hope the moderators give Senator Sanders an opportunity to reverse course on Medicare-for-All and support my plan, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">BetterCare</a>.</p>



<p>“Voters have a clear choice – go down the road of free everything and turn off independent voters and re-elect Trump – or, nominate someone who will bring universal healthcare with choice, increase the safety net for the most vulnerable, grow the economy for all in an environmentally responsible way, and actually win the White House in 2020.”<br><br><br><strong>At last night’s debate, Delaney highlighted his universal health care plan, <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/">BetterCare</a>, which gives all Americans health insurance as a basic human right but preserves private options. Delaney’s answer is transcribed below and can be found <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCPolitics/status/1144055507029831680">online here. </a></strong><br><br>“They like their private health insurance by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans …</p>



<p>“I think we should be the party that&nbsp;keeps what’s working and fixes what&#8217;s broken. I mean doesn&#8217;t that make sense? We should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free. Full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Also its bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates.</p>



<p>“So to some extent we&#8217;re basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed. I mean my dad was a union electrician, right, I actually grew up in a working-class family, he loved the health care that the IBEW gave him and I just always think about my dad and anything I would do from a policy perspective he’d look at me and he’d say good job John for getting healthcare for every American, but why are you taking my healthcare away.”<br> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– Tonight, John Delaney&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/climate-change/">highlighted his $4 trillion climate plan</a>, which features a Carbon Fee and Dividend, support for direct air capture and negative emissions technology, increasing the renewable energy research budget by fivefold, challenge grants to promote innovation, a Climate Corps, and a Carbon Throughway.<br><br>While in Congress, Delaney cosponsored the only bipartisan bill to put a price on carbon emissions and has vowed to make it a first priority for his administration.<br><br><strong>Delaney’s remarks are transcribed below and can be&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1144072980378595328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewed here</a>.</strong><br><br>&#8220;All of the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works. You just have to do it right. You can’t put a price on carbon, raise energy prices, and not give the money back to the American people.</p>



<p>&#8220;My proposal is to put a price on carbon, give a dividend back to the American people. It goes out one pocket, back in the other. I can get that passed my first year as President with a coalition of every Democrat in the Congress and the Republicans who live in coastal states. The Republicans in Florida, they actually care about this issue. This has got to be our way forward if we are actually serious about this issue.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h4 style="text-align:center"><strong>John Delaney&#8217;s Plan For Climate Change</strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>&nbsp;John Delaney is serious about tackling climate change.&nbsp; It’s a big problem and it requires big solutions, which is why Delaney is announcing his $4 trillion Climate Plan that is full of new ideas and innovative solutions.<br><br>According to the IPCC, limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We are already seeing the early effects of climate change, and that level of rapid emissions reductions is necessary to avoid the catastrophic consequences that would result from any further delay. The difference between the warming we have already experienced and the 2°C warming we could see if we don’t act now to reduce emissions is a greater risk of water scarcity, increased sea-level rise, greater damage to ecosystems and animal habitats, declines in human health, and the displacement of millions of people. In addition to the environmental effects, the Department of Defense has characterized climate change as a threat multiplier. Delaney’s plan will put us on the right track to reduce emissions in time to avoid the worst consequences of global warming.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Carbon Fee and Dividend</strong><br>The largest component of Delaney’s climate plan that will have the biggest impact is his Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal. It is time we put a price on carbon to end polluters’ free ride. While in Congress, Delaney introduced the first bipartisan Carbon Fee and Dividend bill in over 10 years. The proposal starts the fee at $15 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;equivalent and increases the cost by $10 each year. Implementing a carbon fee, where the revenue is returned to the American people, is the best method for providing the market incentives to reduce our emissions. Delaney’s Carbon Fee will reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2050. Taxpayers would also be given options with what to do with the dividend, including investing in a tax-advantaged savings account like a 529 for future education purposes or a retirement account. The Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal has bipartisan support from various industries in the private sector as well as the environmental community. However, we need more innovative solutions that will get us to net-zero emissions by 2050.</li></ol>



<ol><li><strong>Direct Air Capture/Negative Emissions Technology (NET)</strong><br>Reducing new carbon emissions and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not be enough to limit global warming. According to the IPCC, to achieve net zero emissions and prevent warming in excess of 1.5°C we will need Negative Emissions Technology, including direct air capture, to remove a minimum of 100 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;from the atmosphere. This technology is currently too expensive to be implemented at the necessary scale, which is why Delaney proposes ending the federal government’s fossil fuel subsidies and making an annual $5 billion investment in NET.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&#8211; Delaney will promote NET, thus bringing down the cost, through a reverse auction program that gives first access to government subsidies to the companies that can capture and store atmospheric carbon for the lowest cost.&nbsp;<br>&#8211; By promoting innovation in NET and implementing the carbon fee, Delaney will create a powerful financial incentive to capture carbon instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. As emitting carbon becomes more expensive due to the increasing carbon fee, it will be more economical to capture the carbon and avoid paying the fee.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increasing Renewable Energy Research Budget 5-Fold</strong><br>We will solve climate change the American way, innovating our way out of the problem. This will require continued robust government support. Delaney proposes a 5-fold increase in DOE green energy programs, including the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and the Office of Nuclear Energy. This investment will support research to improve energy storage, battery performance, sustainable transportation technology, grid efficiency, renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, and energy conservation technology.<br><br>To continue private sector investment in the renewable energy economy, Delaney will bolster renewable energy tax credits.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Challenge Grants</strong><br>To spur climate change innovation in the private and non-profit sectors, Delaney will create a new challenge grant program for significant innovations in:<br>&#8211; Preventing and stopping wildfires<br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from agriculture&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from manufacturing&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Electrification of freight&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Energy storage and transmission<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Climate Corps</strong><br>Delaney proposed the creation of the Climate Corps as part of his National Service Program. The new program would provide opportunities for recent high school graduates to work in low-income urban and rural communities where the Corps members would support these communities’ transition to a green economy, work on environmentally friendly projects, and fight climate change by working on the ground. Under-resourced communities for too long have suffered the most from pollution and climate change, all too often lacking clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. We must provide the manpower and resources to support these communities and recognize that all Americans have a right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment.<br>&nbsp;<br>In partnership with the government, community-based organizations, and local businesses, Climate Corps members can help communities:<br>&#8211; Identify the most pressing local needs that are hindering the community from transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Provide information and support to families about sustainability, energy efficiency, and renewable energy&nbsp;<br>&#8211; Assist in clean energy projects including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Carbon Throughway</strong><br>Climate change skeptics often invoke the false choice of having to choose between jobs or the environment; we can create jobs AND fight climate change at the same time. That’s where the Carbon Throughway comes in.<br><br>The Carbon Throughway is a $20 billion infrastructure project that we will construct to safely transport captured CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to sites for permanent sequestration and reuse. Building the Carbon Throughway will create tens of thousands of jobs and spur new R&amp;D and innovation in carbon capture. The project would be built with federal labor protections using American steel under a project labor agreement and pay workers prevailing wages. To the extent possible, the Throughway will be built along right of ways of existing pipelines and always abide by the strictest environmental standards. As the carbon fee raises the price of releasing emissions and new innovations in NET make carbon capture cost-effective, the Carbon Throughway will provide an additional financial incentive to capture carbon by facilitating its transfer for commercial uses and permanent sequestration.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; At the first Democratic presidential debate tonight, John Delaney explained his Living Wage Plan. Delaney&#8217;s plan doubles the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program, increases the minimum wage, and established paid family leave.</p>



<p>Delaney also highlighted his entrepreneurial background.&nbsp;In 2010, John Delaney&#8217;s business,&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=de3086d900&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CapitalSource, received the Bank Enterprise Award from the Obama Administration Treasury Department</a>&nbsp;for CapitalSource&#8217;s support of Clearinghouse CDFI and Southern California Reinvestment (SoCal) CDFI.</p>



<p><strong>Delaney&#8217;s remarks are transcribed below:</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;I think we need to do real things to help American workers and the American people. This is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail. We need to make sure everyone has a living wage, and I’ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave. That will create a situation where people actually have a living wage. That gets right to workers. Then we have got to fix our public education system. It&#8217;s not delivering the results our kids need, nor is college, and post high school career and technical training programs are doing that. You know, I&#8217;m very different than everyone else here on stage. Prior to being in Congress, I was an entrepreneur. I started two businesses. I created thousands of jobs. I spent my whole career helping small to mid-sized businesses all over the country. Five-thousand of them I supported. The Obama Administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities. I know how to create jobs. We need a short term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with earned income tax credit, raising the minimum wage, and creating paid family leave, and then we need to  have a long term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we are creating jobs everywhere in this country.&#8221;</p>



<p>Delaney&#8217;s full plan can be found online&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=c0dd84b69a&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here.</a></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney’s Living Wage Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Every American worker deserves to earn a living wage. While there has been debate over whether an increase to the minimum wage or an increase of the Earned Income Tax Credit is the right path to increase wages, Delaney believes that the right approach is to increase both.<br><br>Additionally, a true living wage should also account for paid family leave so that workers don’t have to choose between taking leave to care for their newborn or sick loved one and earning enough money to support their family.<br><br>Delaney’s Living Wage proposal includes three new policies:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Creates a New Workers’ Tax Credit</strong><br>Delaney will create a new Workers’ Tax Credit by expanding and nearly doubling the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program. Currently, the EITC’s benefits lift&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=579f4ba2f0&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million adults and nearly 3 million children</a>&nbsp;out of poverty, but these families and others just outside the income thresholds are still struggling to get by. Delaney will provide more support for hardworking families by increasing their tax credits and expanding the program to include more low-income workers.<ol><li>Delaney’s new Workers’ Tax Credit will increase maximum benefits for low-income earners by $1,500 for each eligibility category.</li><li>The new Workers’ Tax Credit would provide much-needed financial assistance to 14 million more households than the current EITC program, an increase of almost 50%.<ol><li>As an example, a single mother of one who earns $20,000 would receive a fully refundable tax credit of more than $5,000.</li></ol></li><li>The Workers’ Tax Credit proposal will be paid for by raising capital gains tax rates on high income earners, repealing the Trump tax cuts for high income earners, and creating a new Robot Tax on job-displacing capital investments.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Minimum Wage Increase</strong><br>No American should still live in poverty if they work full time. Period. The minimum wage has long served as a protection to ensure that workers could make a living, but due to increases to the cost of living, the minimum wage’s inflation-adjusted value has declined by more than 37% since 1968. There have been&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=665e0a2ae9&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no changes to the federal minimum wage since 2009</a>, the longest period in American history without a minimum wage increase. We need to make up for that.<ol><li>Delaney will raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour over time, including for tipped employees, and then index it to inflation.</li><li>Successful recent state-wide ballot initiatives in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, and Washington show widespread bipartisan support for increasing the minimum wage.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Establishes Paid Family Leave</strong><br>The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t provide some form of paid caregiving leave, and it’s time to make a change. Providing guaranteed time off and income replacement will be a major benefit for workers and their families, while funding family leave through the federal government will avoid placing large financial burdens on small businesses.<ol><li>Delaney will establish a new federal paid family leave program, which can be fully paid for with a very small payroll tax increase.<ol><li>Delaney’s plan allows eligible individuals to take up to eight weeks of leave each year, receiving 60% of their monthly wage.</li><li>Workers would be able to take paid leave for a serious health problem; birth and care of a child; placement and care of an adopted child or a child in foster care; or caring for a child, spouse, parent, or domestic partner with a serious health problem.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>



<p><strong>It is impossible to be pro-worker if you’re not pro-business, and it’s impossible to be pro-business if you’re not pro-worker. We have to support both.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Tonight, John Delaney highlighted his plan for universal health care,&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=b4a4ee7b9f&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BetterCare</a>, at the first Democratic primary debate. Delaney’s plan provides all Americans a government health care plan for free, but allows people the ability to keep their private or union-provided plans if they desire.</p>



<p>Delaney&#8217;s remarks are transcribed below and can be&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=4dc42d9f7c&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">viewed here</a>.</p>



<p>&#8220;They like their private health insurance by the way. It should be noted that 100 million Americans …</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we should be the party that&nbsp;keeps what’s working and fixes what&#8217;s broken. I mean doesn&#8217;t that make sense? We should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free. Full stop. But we should also give them the option to buy private insurance. Why do we have to stand for taking away something from people?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Also its bad policy. If you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question, which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the Medicare rate? Every single hospital administrator said they would close. And the Medicare for All bill requires payments to stay at current Medicare rates.</p>



<p>&#8220;So to some extent we&#8217;re basically supporting a bill that will have every hospital closed. I mean my dad was a union electrician, right, I actually grew up in a working-class family, he loved the health care that the IBEW gave him and I just always think about my dad and anything I would do from a policy perspective he’d look at me and he’d say good job John for getting healthcare for every American, but why are you taking my healthcare away.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Michael Starr Hopkins, Delaney’s National Press Secretary releases the following statement:   </strong><br><br>&#8220;If we want to beat Trump in 2020, we can’t do it by embracing socialism or pandering to the loudest voices in the party &#8211; who incorrectly believe that Medicare-for-all is the best path forward. We’ll do it by offering better ideas that improve the lives of all Americans. We must clear about what’s at stake in this election. The cost of doing nothing won’t be nothing, the cost of doing nothing will be the re-election of Donald J. Trump.&#8221;<br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=e4c9b55235&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">Recent polling by Navigator Research</a> on single-payer Medicare for All again reveals that 53% of respondents are opposed to a Medicare for All program that eliminates private insurance. Section 107 of the single-payer Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders (and cosponsored by Senator Harris, Senator Warren, and others) states that private insurance for any benefits covered by Medicare is illegal. </p>
