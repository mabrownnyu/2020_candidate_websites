<p><br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Today, the <em>Washington Post </em>reported that “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/voters-have-big-health-care-worries-but-not-the-ones-democrats-are-talking-about/2019/06/21/5c4a353e-8d22-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html?utm_term=.339d302b4455">Voters have big health-care worries, but not the ones Democrats are talking about</a>.” Instead of Medicare for All, the Post reports that “many voters are not focused on such lofty goals. They want something simpler — to pay less for their own health care.”<br><br>Earlier this year, John Delaney released his plan to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/prescription-drugs/">lower prescription drug prices</a>. Delaney’s plan will lower prescription drug costs through a 100% excise tax on the difference between the cost charged in the United States and the average cost in the developed world. For example, if a drug costs $200 in the United States, but only an average of $140 in similar advanced economy nations, the pharmaceutical company would owe a tax equal to the difference of $60. <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/">Delaney’s BetterCare health care plan</a> would provide everyone access to coverage as a right, but also allow people to opt out and keep their private or union provided plans.<br><br>“Democrats are running the risk of winning the Twitter primary and losing the general election,” <strong>said Delaney Campaign Manager John Davis.</strong> “Many of the leading candidates in this field, including Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and others, want to completely tear down our health care system and replace it with something entirely new. This report from the Post, as well as other recent polling, makes it clear that voters don’t want single-payer and aren’t interested in a podcast-style philosophical debate about health care – they want something that works. John Delaney is one of the few candidates with the courage to speak out against Medicare for All and come forward with a universal health care plan that is tethered to reality.”<br><br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/medicare-for-all-is-political-suicide-for-democrats/2019/06/06/8c41f14c-87d1-11e9-a491-25df61c78dc4_story.html">READ: Delaney &#8211; Medicare for All is political suicide for Democrats</a><br> </p>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, presidential candidate John Delaney joined <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/watch/delaney-democrats-need-to-focus-on-what-matters-to-americans-62503493726">MSNBC</a> after his speech at the South Carolina Democratic Party Convention to talk about infrastructure, the upcoming DNC debate, and the right path toward universal health care.<br><br>“So, I’m running on real solutions, not impossible promises,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong> “I think, respectfully, some of the people I’m running against are running on some impossible promises, and I think that at the end of the day, if we go to the general election running on some of these things, we’re not going to win.”<br><br>“You know, Medicare for All is a good example,” <strong>Delaney continued.</strong> “I want every American to have health care – <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">I have a plan</a> that gives every American basic health care as a right, for free. But I don’t make private insurance illegal. I mean, does anyone really think we’re going to win the general election if we go out and tell the American people that 150 million of you that have private insurance – and a lot of them like it – that we, the Democratic party are going to make that illegal? These are the types of things I’m talking about, which is, let’s do some common sense things, let’s stand for the politics of addition.”<br><br>Delaney’s full speech at the convention can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp8Kf2cX1vo&amp;feature=youtu.be">viewed here</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp8Kf2cX1vo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">.</a><br></p>

<p><strong>COLUMBIA, SC </strong>– This evening, John Delaney discussed his blue-collar roots and called for Democrats to put workers at the center of their efforts in 2020. Earlier today, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/living-wage/" target="_blank">Delaney released his Living Wage Plan</a>, which includes doubling the Earned Income Tax Credit, raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and creating universal paid family leave. <br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1142262809633460224" target="_blank">Delaney’s remarks are available on video here</a> and transcribed below:<br><br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Remarks at Clyburn Fish Fry</strong></p>



<p>Thank you, Jim Clyburn! Let’s hear it for Jim! The incomparable, the extraordinary, the one of a kind Jim Clyburn. Thank you, South Carolina!<br><br>I tell you, the one thing that always struck me about Jim, so I grew up in a working-class family, my dad was an electrician, he was a union electrician. And we didn’t have any fancy conversations around the dinner table about politics. But what he would tell me, all the time, “If you care about workers, you vote for the Democrats!” And I tell you, if we get can back to that lesson, we’re going to win every election. And Jim Clyburn doesn’t let anyone forget about that lesson in the Congress of the United States. <br><br>My friends, together we are on a mission. A mission to find the America that has been lost. Lost through inaction, lost through incivility, lost through a President that lacks a moral compass. We are better than this. Every one of us is better than this. As a country, we are a country of faith, of goodness, of strength and ambition. We saved the world. We created the American Dream for millions of people, including people like myself, who grew up in a blue-collar family, had a successful career in business, and then had the privilege to serve my country. <br><br>But we did it with real solutions, not impossible promises. And we gotta do that again. Whether it’s fixing health care, improving public education, building infrastructure, or creating jobs. We got to do it with real solutions and put the worker at the center of those solutions. That’s what I promise to do as your president. I’ve done it my whole life. <br><br>I don’t want to just be your president, I want to do the job.  God bless you all. Thank you, Jim Clyburn, thank you South Carolina, and thank you for soon sending Jamie Harrison to the Senate of the United States of America.</p>

<h4><em>Plan paid for by raising capital gains tax, new tax on job displacing robots</em></h4>



<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney releases today his three-part Living Wage Plan, a comprehensive plan to boost take home pay and establish universal paid family leave.<br></p>



<p>Delaney’s plan 1) creates a new <strong>Workers’ Tax Credit </strong>which nearly double the existing Earned Income Tax Credit, increasing the maximum benefits for recipients in each category by $1,500; 2) <strong>raises the Minimum Wage to $15</strong> and indexes to inflation and; 3) establishes a <strong>universal Paid Family Leave program </strong>of eight weeks. Delaney’s plans are paid for by raising the capital gains rate on high-income earners, rolling back the Trump tax cuts on high-income earners and creating a new Robot Tax, a tax on job-displacing capital investments.<br></p>



<p>“My Living Wage plan gives tens of millions of Americans higher pay, lower taxes, and better benefits. It’s time to give those that work some of the toughest jobs in America a raise. My new Workers’ Tax Credit expands a bipartisan program, the EITC, that we know works and pairs it with a $15 minimum wage and universal paid family leave, which would really make a difference for working families,” <strong>said John Delaney. </strong>“My plan is fiscally responsible and it’s fair, we can pay for this by rolling back the GOP tax cuts on high-income earners, adjusting the capital gains tax rates with proposals similar to the Buffett Rule, and by taxing robots and machines that displace workers and don’t contribute to the social safety net.  This is what it looks like when we craft policies that are focused on workers.”<br><br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney’s Living Wage Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Every American worker deserves to earn a living wage. While there has been debate over whether an increase to the minimum wage or an increase of the Earned Income Tax Credit is the right path to increase wages, Delaney believes that the right approach is to increase both.<br><br>Additionally, a true living wage should also account for paid family leave so that workers don’t have to choose between taking leave to care for their newborn or sick loved one and earning enough money to support their family.<br><br>Delaney’s Living Wage proposal includes three new policies:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Creates a New Workers’ Tax Credit</strong><br>Delaney will create a new Workers’ Tax Credit by expanding and nearly doubling the existing Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program. Currently, the EITC’s benefits lift&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policy-basics-the-earned-income-tax-credit">2.8 million adults and nearly 3 million children</a>&nbsp;out of poverty, but these families and others just outside the income thresholds are still struggling to get by. Delaney will provide more support for hardworking families by increasing their tax credits and expanding the program to include more low-income workers.<ol><li>Delaney’s new Workers’ Tax Credit will increase maximum benefits for low-income earners by $1,500 for each eligibility category.</li><li>The new Workers’ Tax Credit would provide much-needed financial assistance to 14 million more households than the current EITC program, an increase of almost 50%.<ol><li>As an example, a single mother of one who earns $20,000 would receive a fully refundable tax credit of more than $5,000.</li></ol></li><li>The Workers’ Tax Credit proposal will be paid for by raising capital gains tax rates on high income earners, repealing the Trump tax cuts for high income earners, and creating a new Robot Tax on job-displacing capital investments.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Minimum Wage Increase</strong><br>No American should still live in poverty if they work full time. Period. The minimum wage has long served as a protection to ensure that workers could make a living, but due to increases to the cost of living, the minimum wage’s inflation-adjusted value has declined by more than 37% since 1968. There have been&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/business/us-minimum-wage-by-year/index.html">no changes to the federal minimum wage since 2009</a>, the longest period in American history without a minimum wage increase. We need to make up for that.<ol><li>Delaney will raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour over time, including for tipped employees, and then index it to inflation.</li><li>Successful recent state-wide ballot initiatives in Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, and Washington show widespread bipartisan support for increasing the minimum wage.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Establishes Paid Family Leave</strong><br>The United States is the only industrialized country that doesn’t provide some form of paid caregiving leave, and it’s time to make a change. Providing guaranteed time off and income replacement will be a major benefit for workers and their families, while funding family leave through the federal government will avoid placing large financial burdens on small businesses.<ol><li>Delaney will establish a new federal paid family leave program, which can be fully paid for with a very small payroll tax increase.<ol><li>Delaney’s plan allows eligible individuals to take up to eight weeks of leave each year, receiving 60% of their monthly wage.</li><li>Workers would be able to take paid leave for a serious health problem; birth and care of a child; placement and care of an adopted child or a child in foster care; or caring for a child, spouse, parent, or domestic partner with a serious health problem.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol>



<p><strong>It is impossible to be pro-worker if you’re not pro-business, and it’s impossible to be pro-business if you’re not pro-worker. We have to support both.</strong></p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“Withdrawing from the Iran agreement, alienating our allies, and ramping up the pressure on Iran without a clear strategy has created an inherently dangerous situation in the region and is a foreign policy failure by the Trump administration.  Make no mistake about it, Iran is a horrible actor &#8211; they sponsor terror, undermine the interest of the U.S. and our allies, and work to actively destabilize the Middle East.  If they shot down a U.S. asset over international territory, they must be held accountable.   <br><br>“We need a President with a strong and stable hand and strategic approach; we should not contribute mindlessly to conditions which could spark a crisis, put the extraordinary men and women of the U.S. military at risk, and undermine the interests of the citizens of the United States.”<br> </p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD &#8211;&nbsp;</strong>Ahead of President Trump&#8217;s re-election campaign launch,&nbsp;John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>&#8220;What we will see and hear from the President in Orlando tonight is more of the same; empty promises, fear mongering, and lies. Thankfully, Democrats have a chance to beat him and his corrupt Administration where it counts most, at the ballot box on Election Day.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>&#8220;Republicans are already stepping over each other to label the Democratic Party as the party of socialism, impossible promises or indifferent to the struggles facing hardworking Americans.&nbsp; We should not give them that opportunity.&nbsp;</strong>We should not make this election about&nbsp;socialism or throwing out the entire economic model of the United States of America. The best strategy for Democrats to beat Donald Trump is to put forth a nominee who is focused on solving the real problems facing the American people, getting our country working again with big ideas to fix healthcare, building infrastructure, and improving education, and restoring honor and integrity to the Presidency. It is time to turn the page on Trump and the last several decades of broken American politics.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – New polling on single-payer Medicare for All again reveals that when people are told <em>what Medicare for All actually is,</em> support for it drastically drops. <br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__navigatorresearch.org_navigating-2Dthe-2Dmedicare-2Ddebate_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=ZOcg25NlHfCE3HTAuxig5vMLrQSpEIMRd8bzJ26lU5g&amp;m=pCGS5igACCZtxvkxO9J6WEErMrr2htIU0XqnvSQjVvM&amp;s=KGe_03xKqAryZOlm5wbr4uiUznSIpm49h2m018R0sfY&amp;e=" target="_blank">Polling conducted May 31 &#8211; June 3 month by the Navigator Research</a> reveals that 53% of respondents are opposed to a Medicare for All program that eliminates private insurance. The poll found that allowing people to buy in or keep private insurance has a net approval of +46%, while eliminating private insurance has a net approval of -6%. <br><br>Section 107 of the single-payer Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders (and cosponsored by Senator Harris, Senator Warren, and others) states that private insurance for any benefits covered by Medicare is illegal. <br><br>The pollsters found that “support for Medicare for All is driven more by branding with the term ‘Medicare’ than by specific knowledge of the program.” Similarly, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.kff.org_health-2Dreform_press-2Drelease_poll-2Dmost-2Damericans-2Ddont-2Drealize-2Dhow-2Ddramatically-2Dmedicare-2Dfor-2Dall-2Dproposals-2Dwould-2Drevamp-2Dnations-2Dhealth-2Dcare-2Dsystem_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=ZOcg25NlHfCE3HTAuxig5vMLrQSpEIMRd8bzJ26lU5g&amp;m=pCGS5igACCZtxvkxO9J6WEErMrr2htIU0XqnvSQjVvM&amp;s=koE8y9w6JuozKMsPsLUsVN7bCGjkBwyMPhk4Xyh0UOg&amp;e=" target="_blank">a KFF Health Tracking Poll released today found evidence</a> that “most Americans don’t realize how dramatically the Medicare for All proposals would revamp the Nation’s health care system.”<br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__thehill.com_hilltv_what-2Damericas-2Dthinking_428958-2Dpoll-2Dvoters-2Dwant-2Dthe-2Dgovernment-2Dto-2Dprovide-2Dhealthcare-2Dfor&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=ZOcg25NlHfCE3HTAuxig5vMLrQSpEIMRd8bzJ26lU5g&amp;m=pCGS5igACCZtxvkxO9J6WEErMrr2htIU0XqnvSQjVvM&amp;s=XOVdXDVady_lBSR8-XcVMJeFRZ17wUhsYbRpyi_n5PY&amp;e=" target="_blank">A Hill-HarrisX poll from February found that only 13% of respondents</a> would prefer a health care system that covers all citizens and doesn&#8217;t allow for private plans.<br><br>“The supposed political popularity of Medicare for All is a myth,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong> “People like Medicare and they like the phrase, but when people are told what this legislation actually does, most people don’t want it. Making private insurance illegal is bad policy and bad politics and the truth is, the leading supporters of Medicare for All know this  – that’s why they attacked me. If the truth I dared to speak was actually politically unpopular, it would have made no sense for some people to demand that I drop out of the race, particularly since I had already proposed a universal health care plan that gives every American a health care plan for free, but allows for the continuation of private insurance. But instead, they don’t want there to be any debate at all. I’m not going to let that happen.”<br><br><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.johndelaney.com_issues_health-2Dcare_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;r=ZOcg25NlHfCE3HTAuxig5vMLrQSpEIMRd8bzJ26lU5g&amp;m=pCGS5igACCZtxvkxO9J6WEErMrr2htIU0XqnvSQjVvM&amp;s=aHV0IMJai-sCGt6LVepTalo1r6d2vYg_v2ExJT7qnBQ&amp;e=" target="_blank">Delaney’s universal health care plan</a>, BetterCare, provides everyone with a government plan as a right, but allows people to opt out and purchase private insurance or supplemental plans.</p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;&#8211; John Delaney releases the following statement after the announcement of the first DNC Debate lineup:</p>



<p>&#8220;The focus of the first debate should be on how we solve the real problems facing hard-working Americans, particularly health care. I look forward to laying out how my health care plan &#8211; &#8216;BetterCare&#8217; &#8211; is both superior health care policy, and a much smarter way forward, than Senator Sanders plan, Medicare for All. The American people want universal health care, but they don&#8217;t want an approach that forces half the country to switch their plans or that under invests in quality.&nbsp; I am also pleased to be sharing the debate stage with many strong candidates, particularly Senator Warren who, like me, is talking about new ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to a debate on issues and solutions, not personality and politics.&#8221;</p>
