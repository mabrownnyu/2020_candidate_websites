<p>Suzanne Herzog</p>



<p>Des Moines Register</p>



<p>March 4, 2019</p>



<p>Delaney understands the cost of doing nothing</p>



<p>Politically I am an independent, but I still attended a Democratic gala in November 2017 because I was eager to get my health-care reform proposals out to anyone running for office.</p>



<p>I am a health economist and my goal was to help steer public conversation toward real, collaborative solutions: recognizing what the Affordable Care Act had gotten right, where it went totally wrong and where we go from here. Rep. John Delaney&#8217;s 2020 general election team was already here. They received my printed basic proposals and contacted me a couple months later to hear him speak in person on one of his first visits to Iowa.</p>



<p>Meeting him in person, I was blown away by Delaney&#8217;s in-depth understanding of the topic. He articulated solutions and conclusions that were similar to what years of analysis had lead me to. He presented understanding of a woefully overlooked middle ground in public debate.</p>



<p>You can’t beat the sense of urgency and initiative he conveys with comments like, “the price of doing nothing is not nothing,&#8221; suggesting that we can’t afford to keep missing precious opportunities to stay ahead as a nation on the world stage.</p>



<p>Seriously sensible, competent, collaborative and committed, Delaney is still ahead of the pack.</p>

<h2><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/03/04/presidential-candidate-answer-policy-questions/">The Smartest Presidential Candidate You&#8217;ve Never Heard Of </a></strong></h2>



<p><strong>3/4/19</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:left"><strong>By Jennifer Rubin</strong></p>



<p>Last July, I started asking prominent Democrats their views on substantive policy questions. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who actually initiated the exercise with her sua sponte answers, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti both have participated. So has Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).<br><br>This time I asked former Maryland congressman John Delaney, the first Democrat to declare for president, about some top domestic policy issues. Delaney is a moderate and a successful entrepreneur, and he has a big staff in Iowa. It’s critical for him to make the debates (requiring&nbsp;1 percent in three polls or 65,000 donors, which he claims to have). He’ll get a chance to introduce himself to the country in a March 10&nbsp;town hall. In the meantime, here are his answers to our questions, followed by a few observations.<br><br><strong>What’s the right balance of taxes, spending and debt?</strong><br>The right balance of taxes and spending would produce deficits of about 2 percent across the long term. Under my economic policies, I believe the economy can consistently grow at least 2.5 percent per year, and if we can manage long-term annual deficits to be less than the level of annual economic growth, then the debt as a percentage of our economy will go down, which is what matters. The key metric is debt as a percentage of gross domestic product, and I would like to start slowly lowering that ratio to be more in line with historical averages. To achieve this, we need to increase revenue, which I would do by: (1) implementing a form of the “Buffet rule,” which involves synchronizing capital gains tax rates with ordinary income tax rates. We do not need a lower capital gains rate; that is an outdated incentive and contributes meaningfully to the structural unfairness in the tax code as investors pay lower taxes than workers, (2) by rolling back the tax cuts on high earners from the GOP tax reform, and (3) by raising corporate tax rates — not to where they were — but to about 27 percent. On the spending side, we have to lower long-term spending growth, which should be focused on fixing health care. Health care is the main long-term driver of our spending problems, and I have proposed a fully paid-for universal health-care plan that can do this (after we fix the Affordable Care Act!). We also have to address Social Security. [Republican Rep.] Tom Cole and I have introduced a commission bill (similar to the Greenspan Commission) to address the long-term solvency of Social Security.<br><br><strong>If the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other trade deals have economic and geopolitical benefits, what do you say to workers who are displaced?</strong><br>I tell workers that we have let them down by failing to respond to globalization and technology, which have been enormously positive for society and the world but not for many of them. As my dad the union electrician used to say, “a good job is everything.” I want to keep positioning the United States to compete globally with deals like TPP, but I will not forget about workers that are hurt by globalization. My approach is to think globally and invest locally. I would pair trade deals with domestic economic programs like infrastructure and with an agenda for turning around distressed communities. I was a leader on the “Opportunity Zone” legislation in the House, which created a federal tax incentive for investors to invest in Opportunity Zones. I would pair that with an incentive for government contractors to locate in Opportunity Zones, building more infrastructure in them and increasing the earned-income tax credit (which should be the center of our tax policy). We also need an agenda to address changes in work driven by artificial intelligence and automation. This involves changes in public education, creating ongoing training capabilities and developing creative compensation structures for jobs that are currently being done in society (like caregivers) that add meaningful societal value but are not currently compensated. Working together, these polices would cause investment capital and jobs to flow to communities left behind and help workers prepare for change.<br><br><strong>Facebook and other tech companies have become the equivalent of utilities, yet they are essentially unregulated. How should we regulate them to address problems such as privacy and foreign interference in elections?</strong><br>We should pass federal privacy legislation similar to what California passed. We should require full disclosure of who buys campaign ads on digital platforms. As part of a national AI strategy, we should address tech addiction and programming bias. We should harness the best in innovation but also protect our citizens. My wife [April] is the Washington director of Common Sense Media and is a leader in these areas.<br><br><strong>Big companies engage in bidding wars to open or expand facilities in exchange for tax and other incentives. What problems do you have with this, and does it perpetuate inequality?</strong><br>This practice does not help net U.S. job growth, it is a race to the bottom and it is effectively a form of corporate subsidies, many of which (but not all) have proved to have very low returns on investment relative to other investments. For example, I found the Amazon process unseemly, but at the same time I believe New York City made a mistake rejecting them. It is my sense that the package NYC offered was justified based on the assurances Amazon provided. The dynamic exists for these “auctions” because so many areas are hungry for economic development. Last year 80 percent of venture capital funding went to 50 counties in the United States. This has created massive inequality of opportunity and is turning the country into a nation of birthright instead of a country of opportunity. We need real polices that foster broader economic development so that fewer locations show up with bids the next time a corporation wants to run a national auction. [Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.]<br><br><strong>What’s your solution to skyrocketing college tuition costs and student debt?</strong><br>Post-high school graduation, every American should be able to attend community college or obtain career and technical training at no cost. The eligible programs should meet quality and graduation metrics in order to qualify. We should also have more creative loan repayment programs tied to income and work to lower the payments on student loans. Working together, this would allow a student to obtain two years of college at no cost and then finish the last two years at a lower cost. I have also called for a national service program that gives all high school graduates the opportunity (but not the obligation) to serve their country, either in the military, by doing community service, or through a new “infrastructure” program to rebuild parks and federal assets. In addition to all the unifying benefits and skill building associated with this, we could provide discounted student loans to students who serve, which would create another avenue for lower college costs.<br><br><strong>My responses</strong>:<br>As a preliminary matter, Delaney should get credit for direct, substantive answers, especially on the debt. He’s the first Democrat who’s answered these questions to specify how much debt we can carry and to address reform of Social Security.<br><br>On trade, Delaney seems to have hit upon an economically and politically viable solution: open up foreign markets and use domestic legislation, not tariffs, to address the adverse effect on American workers. He and other Democrats should also be forthright about the availability of the World Trade Organization to address foreign unfair competition. If that body needs reform, we should push forward so countries have viable remedies and need not resort to unwinnable trade wars.<br><br>Delaney makes a smart point about the concentration of venture capital in relatively few places. We’d like to hear him expound more on the trail about what to do about this. It’s the chicken-or-egg problem: Without investment and the promise of good jobs, it’s hard to set up a world-class university or make huge expenditures in infrastructure, which are needed to attract investment. We’d like to see candidates address an unpopular but perhaps necessary solution, namely moving people from distressed areas to where the high-tech jobs are instead of moving the high-tech jobs to distressed areas.<br><br>On education, Delaney and other candidates rightly stress alternatives to four-year schools. However, four-year college tuition even at public schools has skyrocketed, to the dismay of middle-class families. It would be interesting to see if college presidents were treated like oil company executives — hauled before Congress to explain the price gouging and whether there is any price fixing going on. Moreover, should uber-expensive universities with billions in endowment money get to keep their nonprofit status, especially if they continue charging students ungodly amounts for a diploma? No<em>&nbsp;there’s</em>&nbsp;a way to raise revenue — or pressure universities to start lowering their prices.</p>

<p><strong>By Brianne Pfannenstiel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Des Moines Register, January 7, 2019</strong></p>
<p>Presidential candidate John Delaney has hired several senior Iowa staffers and will open six new field offices across the state in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Delaney, who just ended his third term as a U.S. representative from Maryland, was the first to announce a 2020 presidential run, launching his campaign in October 2017.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our campaign spent most of last year laying the groundwork and introducing Congressman Delaney to Iowans,” Monica Biddix said in a statement.</p>
<p>Biddix, who has served as Delaney&#8217;s Iowa communications director since last July, will take over as his state director. She previously managed Andy McGuire&#8217;s 2018 gubernatorial primary campaign and before that was the communications director for the Iowa Democratic Party.</p>
<p>&#8220;We’re excited to hit the ground running in 2019 with a solid, statewide organization and offices from river to river,&#8221; she said in the statement. &#8220;Our campaign is committed to assembling a team that looks like Iowa and the rest of the country, including members of the African-American, Latino, LGBTQ+ communities and veterans.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other hires include:</p>
<p>Mark Galinsky, who will serve as deputy state director and formerly worked for Delaney in a variety of roles on both his campaign and congressional staff, including as his campaign&#8217;s Iowa outreach director.</p>
<p>Michelle Bruggenthies, who is Delaney&#8217;s Iowa caucus director. In 2018, Bruggenthies managed Jackie Smith&#8217;s successful Iowa state Senate race and, in 2016, she was a regional field director in northwest Iowa for Bernie Sanders&#8217; 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Marcia Rogers, who has worked on political campaigns across Iowa, owns North Shore Partners and is Delaney&#8217;s political director.</p>
<p>Rachel Potucek, who was the communications director for the Democratic Party of Orange County in California during the 2018 midterms and is the campaign&#8217;s deputy communications director.</p>
<p>It was announced in October 2018 that Greg Hauenstein will serve as Delaney&#8217;s Iowa digital director. He worked on Barack Obama&#8217;s 2008 caucus campaign, was the digital director for the Iowa Democratic Party and was the lead web developer for public affairs and political strategy firm GPS Impact in Des Moines.</p>
<p>With the new additions, Delaney now has 24 staffers in Iowa.</p>
<p>The campaign&#8217;s new Des Moines office, located at 2415 Ingersoll Ave., is scheduled to open on Jan. 12. Others are set to open in Cedar Rapids, Council Bluffs, Davenport, Sioux City and Waterloo in the coming weeks, according to the campaign.</p>

<p><strong>By Adam Sexton</strong></p>
<p><strong>WMUR, January 8, 2019</strong></p>
<p>He was first in the 2020 race, and now former U.S. Rep. John Delaney, of Maryland, is first to ramp up his New Hampshire presidential campaign with a pair of key hires.</p>
<p>Delaney is bringing in a former aide, Chris MacKenzie, as state director for his campaign.</p>
<p>MacKenzie was raised in Hopkinton, and before joining the Delaney campaign he most recently worked as communications director for Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Ala.</p>
<p>MacKenzie previously served in the congressman’s Washington office and as regional field director during Delaney’s first campaign for Congress in 2012.</p>
<p>“I am truly honored to help lead John’s presidential campaign in my home state of New Hampshire,” MacKenzie said. “I worked with John when he first ran for Congress and saw firsthand how he built excitement and momentum behind big ideas for the future. Voters need a candidate who is going to stop dividing and start delivering.”</p>
<p>Delaney is also staying local for his deputy political director, hiring Casey Neal, who just finished working as organizing director for Free &amp; Fair New Hampshire, Colin Van Ostern’s campaign for secretary of state.</p>
<p>Delaney will return to New Hampshire next week for his 13th trip to the Granite State since launching his presidential campaign in 2017.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>John Delaney is Playing the Long Game</strong></p>
<p><strong>By Elaine Godfrey</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atlantic, December 10, 2018</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Maryland Democrat and 2020 presidential candidate has visited all 99 of Iowa’s counties—well before many better-known Democrats have even decided whether to run.</strong></p>
<p>On Tuesday, John Delaney wrapped up his 20th visit to the state of Iowa.</p>
<p>The Maryland Democrat announced his presidential intentions way back in July 2017—more than three years before the 2020 election. He’s already visited each of Iowa’s 99 counties, spent $1.5 million on television ads in the state, and hired dozens of staffers—all before big-name Democratic contenders such as Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have even decided whether to run.</p>
<p>“By going around and doing what I’m doing, meeting with thousands and thousands of Iowans,” Delaney told me in an interview this week, “you can distinguish yourself in a crowded field.”</p>
<p>But who, exactly, is he?</p>
<p>Delaney, who represents Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District, which stretches from Appalachia to the Washington suburbs, is often described as a political moderate. In reality, he checks several progressive boxes: He’s a proponent of universal health care (though not a single-payer system), a $15 minimum wage, and the expansion of early-childhood education. Last month, he joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers to propose carbon-tax legislation. “The way I go about getting progressive things done is by finding common ground,” Delaney said.</p>
<p>Through his early efforts in Iowa, Delaney has positioned himself as a unifier, pledging that as president, he would work to resolve America’s increasing political polarization and put forward legislation with support from both parties. Iowa Democrats told me in interviews that they find his approach refreshing—a kind of throwback to the pre-Trump political era—and each one of the dozen activists and party leaders I spoke with this week seemed to genuinely like the guy.</p>
<p>But it’s still not clear that John Delaney is the kind of candidate Democrats want to put up against Trump in 2020. And with some 400 days until the Iowa caucuses—and many more well-known candidates left to announce their own presidential bids—there is still plenty of time for him to get lost in the fray. “There’s gotta be something about him that rises above another congressperson running for president, because there’s gonna be a lot of those,” said Jake Oeth, the Iowa state director for former Maryland Governor Martin O’Malley’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>In our interview on Tuesday, Delaney described himself as a “different kind of Democrat,” highlighting, as he often does during his Iowa campaign stops, his blue-collar upbringing and business acumen. The 55-year-old Democrat was born and raised in New Jersey and attended Columbia University in New York with the help of scholarships from his father’s labor union, as well as the local American Legion and Lions Club. Young Delaney then went on to get a law degree from Georgetown and co-found two publicly traded companies: Health Care Financial Partners, which provided loans to small health-care providers, and CapitalSource, a commercial lender. The congressman, who was at one point the youngest CEO in the history of the New York Stock Exchange, has accumulated a fortune of more than $200 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, making him the third-wealthiest member of Congress. “I’m a strong believer in the American private economy, the greatest innovation machine ever created,” Delaney told me.</p>
<p>The Maryland Democrat is much more of a policy wonk than a rhetorical charmer, and he spends more time talking about national unity than he does about Donald Trump. In a recent interview with the editorial board of the Des Moines Register, Delaney summed up what he views as the central issue facing the country: “How do we take this terribly divided nation, where American is pitted against American, and how do we start bringing it back together and restoring a sense of unity and common purpose to our country?”</p>
<p>While it’s not exactly rare to find a politician preaching national unity on the campaign trail, Delaney says he’s different. Others might give lip service to bipartisanship, he told me, “but I’m the only one actually focused on that.”</p>
<p>During his time in Congress, the multimillionaire lawmaker teamed up with two Republicans to push for legislation that would use revenue from international tax reform to fund various infrastructure projects. On the campaign trail in Iowa, Delaney has pledged that, if elected, he would only introduce legislation that receives bipartisan support for his first 100 days in office. Some of his top priorities for those first few months include passing a comprehensive infrastructure package, doubling the earned-income tax credit, and establishing an optional National Service Program for young people between high school and college.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">WASHINGTON — The world’s oldest political party has developed an aversion to discretion. The Democratic Party is manacled to an over-caffeinated base that believes that deft government can deliver parity of status to everyone while micromanaging the economy’s health care sector, which is larger than all but three other foreign nations’ economies. Inconveniently, the party must appeal to voters who, living in dread of their next interaction with the department of motor vehicles, yearn only for governmental adequacy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why John Delaney, who is ending a three-term tenure as a Democratic congressman from Maryland, is seeking his party’s presidential nomination. His quest will test whether Democrats’ detestation of Donald Trump is stronger than their enthusiasm for identity politics: A white male businessman, Delaney comes to bat with three strikes against him.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Suppose, however, Democrats are more interested in scrubbing the current presidential stain from public life than they are in virtue-signaling and colonizing the far shores of leftwingery. Delaney is much more than an example of the If-Donald Trump-Can-Be-Elected-So-Can-My-Cocker-Spaniel response to 2016.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">His grandparents, he says, “made pencils and worked the docks.” He did not become wealthy, as today’s businessman-turned-president did, through a father’s largesse supplemented by tax chicanery. Neither of Delaney’s parents went to college. His father was a 60-year member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. An IBEW scholarship, and support from the American Legion, VFW and Lion’s Club, helped Delaney through Columbia University. After Georgetown Law School, where he met his wife, he founded a financial company and became the youngest-ever CEO on the New York Stock Exchange. His next company invests in small and midsize companies. In 2017, Fortune magazine included him among the “World’s 50 Greatest Leaders.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Solidly built and impeccably tailored, Delaney, 55, is a Democrat who believes in what he has lived: upward mobility, with assistance. He recognizes the obvious, that globalization has been “extraordinarily positive” for billions more people than it has injured, but its American casualties are real and deserve government help. He speaks with the calm confidence of one who understands, as the man he hopes to displace does not, that the lungs are not the seat of wisdom. He checks various boxes that might mollify all but the most fastidious progressives: He likes early childhood education, a carbon tax, a $15 minimum wage and extending the Social Security tax to higher incomes. He dislikes the NRA, the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision, high interest rates on student loans and “outrageous” drug prices. He would achieve “universal” health care by offering Medicaid for all, and for those who choose to opt for private programs, as he thinks most people would, there would be federal subsidies for those who need them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He says “the screaming top headline” from the midterm elections was that moderate Democrats won. Few not occupying safe seats won while hollering “Single payer health care!” and “Abolish ICE!” and “Impeachment!”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is Delaney’s persona — think of a Joe Biden 20 years younger and half as prolix — that will distinguish him and seem either pleasingly adult or insufficiently carbonated when the prancing ponies from the U.S. Senate come cantering into Iowa. If the nomination scramble is a decibel competition, Delaney will lose — and the winning Democrat probably will lose in the November 2020 rendezvous with him who specializes in loud.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Delaney illustrates the reason for tolerating what Iowa considers a Mandate of Heaven — its entitlement to begin the nomination process. Iowans are so thin on the ground that relentless retail politicking can give a dark horse candidate a fighting chance against the ponies who, being senators and hence barely employed, have ample time to flit around the country raising money and their pretty profiles before coming to where the tall corn grows. Delaney, who is not neglecting New Hampshire, has been tilling Iowa’s political soil as an announced candidate for more than 475 days, and long since exceeded 50 percent name recognition among Democratic Iowans. He has visited all 99 counties with more than 440 days remaining before the 2020 caucuses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the 10 presidential cycles since Jimmy Carter’s 1976 win in Iowa made the caucuses important, six Democrats have won competitive caucuses and then their party’s nomination: President Carter (defeating Ted Kennedy) in 1980, Walter Mondale in 1984, Al Gore in 2000, John Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008, Hillary Clinton in 2016. Delaney in 2020? Democrats could do much worse. They generally do, and probably will. As in 2016, Trump is counting on it.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">By Maggie Astor</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times, 11/10/18</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">DES MOINES — Partway through his stump speech at the Iowa State Fair in August, Representative John Delaney spotted a familiar face walking by.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Mr. Speaker!” he called from his perch atop The Des Moines Register’s soapbox. “What a nice surprise. Speaker Boehner is in the house. You’re looking good, Mr. Speaker. I appreciate you coming out and supporting me, I really do.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">John Boehner, the former House speaker, wearing a blue-and-white gingham shirt almost identical to Mr. Delaney’s — and looking distinctly as though he wished he had taken a different route from the pork chop stand to the parking lot — was instantly surrounded by reporters.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I worked on a lot of stuff with him. He’s a good member,” was about all Mr. Boehner, a Republican, would say of Mr. Delaney, a Maryland Democrat running for president. “Oh God. I’m just walking by. If it weren’t Delaney there — I’m walking by, I got a pork chop, I was walking by, I saw Delaney. I said, ‘Aw, I’ll stop.’ I should have known better. I should have kept walking.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was hardly a reaffirming moment for Mr. Delaney, but he will take any recognition he can get. Political junkies like to joke that the 2020 campaign began the moment the polls closed on Tuesday, but Mr. Delaney is already more than a year into his.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He is well aware that better-known Democratic politicians like Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are attracting more news coverage even though they have not yet officially declared, and he knows that even though he is the only major candidate running right now, he is running from behind.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So why do it? “I think I’m the right person for the job, but not enough people knew who I was or still know who I am,” Mr. Delaney, 55, said. “The way to solve that problem, it seems to me, is to get in early and just work harder than everyone else.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While Mr. Boehner’s clear discomfort showed how little he had expected to run into a campaign-trail press scrum more than two years before the 2020 election, Mr. Delaney seemed to thoroughly enjoy the pageantry in Iowa, whose caucuses are the first test for presidential candidates at the ballot box. He strolled over to WHO-HD’s corn poll and dropped a kernel in a jar for Fred Hubbell, the Democratic candidate for governor, who would lose three months later. He grabbed a rug and went on the Giant Slide with the youngest of his four daughters, Grace, 11, who looked unconvinced of the wisdom of this activity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">That night, he would cheerfully recall the Boehner encounter in a speech at the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And two days later, he would hit the last of Iowa’s 99 counties, completing a classic campaign feat before any better-known opponent started. He isn’t running for re-election to the House, the better to go “all in” on running for president.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s hard to overstate how unusual Mr. Delaney’s timeline is. He announced his candidacy on July 28, 2017, almost three years before the Democratic convention. John T. Woolley, co-director of the American Presidency Project at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said that with the arguable exception of President Trump, whose campaign apparatus never disbanded after 2016, he didn’t know of “any case of a serious major-party candidate announcing so far before the election.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Characteristically for a man who spent much of his career in finance — and who listened to one Iowan describe how the cost of his medication had skyrocketed and proceeded to calculate the “annual compounded increase” in his head — Mr. Delaney likened his campaign start date to inflation-adjusted dollars. “Campaigns have gotten much longer,” he said. “When Jimmy Carter announced, which was effectively right after the midterms — back then, on a relative pace, this was similar to what I’m doing now.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Mr. Carter was the quintessential “came out of nowhere” candidate, something Mr. Delaney hopes to duplicate. But the retail politicking that lifted Mr. Carter in 1976 is not as decisive as it once was. Around this time in 2015, the five Republicans who had visited Iowa the most were all polling in the bottom half of the pack. Two days after the caucuses in 2016, not one was still in the race.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, by some measures, Mr. Delaney’s strategy has been effective. In an Emerson College poll in September, only 21 percent of Iowa voters were unfamiliar with him. At the Iowa State Fair, one couple — Connie Waller, 74, and Don Waller, 75, farmers in nearby Van Meter — even recognized him from his TV ads.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“He’s just coming out and saying, ‘Here’s who I am and here’s what I believe in,’” Ms. Waller said approvingly. “I like him right now. But there’s not a lot of others.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>WASHINGTON</strong> – On Thursday, the <a href="https://www.insidesources.com/we-must-do-better-2/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.insidesources.com/we-must-do-better-2/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1541262540942000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSikZV50En4WvKiUExOG2JqgbUtQ">New Hampshire Journal published an op-ed authored by presidential candidate Congressman John Delaney</a> in which he calls for a renewed sense of commitment to unity and common purpose and to reject the divisive, toxic political environment of today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this week, <em>Wall Street Journal’s, </em>Gerald Seib, wrote a column on the “angry national mood”, concluding his <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/violence-that-changes-everythingand-nothing-1540823283?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.wsj.com/articles/violence-that-changes-everythingand-nothing-1540823283?mod%3Dsearchresults%26page%3D1%26pos%3D1&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1541262540942000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHZkJj3BhFgPFNoE3ZAv0WChKzzuA">piece by commenting on Congressman John K. Delaney’s efforts to offer an alternative built around civility and unity.</a> Seib references Delaney’s book, <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250294975" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://us.macmillan.com/books/9781250294975&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1541262540942000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHyB2EVEn9eIBQk2J-2YATKli4ZQ"><em>The Right Answer – How We Can Unify Our Divided Nation</em></a>, which is focused on ending partisan warfare and building a new political culture around compromise and respect.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em> </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a href="https://www.insidesources.com/we-must-do-better-2/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.insidesources.com/we-must-do-better-2/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1541262540942000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGSikZV50En4WvKiUExOG2JqgbUtQ">New Hampshire Journal: We must do better</a></strong></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It doesn’t have to be like this. It shouldn’t be like this. And it is up to all of us to make it better.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Every American, of every political stripe, should be horrified by the events of the last week. First, we saw a systematic attack on journalists, private citizens and past and present Democratic leaders, through a series of politically-motivated mail bombs. Then, on Saturday, tragedy struck in Pittsburgh, as 11 people were killed and six others wounded in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last week did not happen in a vacuum, however, it happened as part of a toxic political environment, an environment that gets worse each day. It’s one thing to denounce extreme acts, it’s another to have the courage and strength to rebuild our political culture top to bottom. But that’s what it’s going to take because we must not go on like this.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have been close, on multiple occasions, to both Republican and Democratic members of Congress being assassinated. We’ve seen people murdered, because of their faith, in their house of worship. We have seen journalists attacked. We have seen members of the public threatened as insane conspiracy theories lead armed gunman to appear in restaurants. All of this plays out against a backdrop of a daily coarsening of public life.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you’ve attended a political event in the last decade, you’ve seen it. There’s a sharper edge, a new negative energy, a new willingness to attack and accuse. Close your eyes and imagine the lines that get the biggest applause at a political rally. What are you hearing? Chances are, it’s not a line that inspires hope. On social media, it’s even worse. There’s so much hate.  Where is Lincoln, surely one of the strongest of our Presidents, admonishing those that would divide us – “We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection” – and then reminding us of the better story to come – “The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We can’t keep going on like this. We can’t undo the past, but we can make the future better.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Those of us in office, most importantly the President, or those running for office must hold ourselves and everyone else to a higher standard of conduct and rhetoric – the constant dehumanizing attacks on elected officials, candidates, public figures and members of the press must end. The constant references to violence, chants about locking people up, and harassment in restaurants and public places must end. The language of warfare and demonization must end. The language of hate must end.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have to stop talking about our political opponents and their supporters like they are the enemy and 100% wrong about everything they believe. When we can’t see anyone on the other side as thoughtful and human, just about anything becomes acceptable.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Unless we bring the country together and reaffirm the notion of unity and common purpose, we will live in a world of increased division and discord that will incite more troubled people to real and tragic violence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The stakes are incredibly high and they demand people stepping forward and doing the right thing. We have to campaign differently and we have to govern differently. Even if it means losing an election. We can’t compromise our values and our decency every time the Oval Office or a Senate majority or a Supreme Court seat is at stake, because ultimately we’ll have nothing left. We’ll leave the next generation a shell of a country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I believe there is still a deeper unity within us. Days after the shooting in Pittsburgh, I attended an interfaith service at Adas Israel in Washington. People from across the community stood in solidarity with our Jewish neighbors and friends, standing up against hate and against anti-Semitism.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We need to find ways to bring the country together again. We need to do real things like national service to unify our people. We need to start talking about where we can agree rather than where we disagree.  We need to work together to actually improve people’s lives, rather than settling scores and punishing our enemies.  We must do better on all fronts, and we can.  As Michelle Obama said, “when they go low, we go high.”  Our politics has gone really low in the last few years, let’s lift it up to new heights.<em> </em></p>
