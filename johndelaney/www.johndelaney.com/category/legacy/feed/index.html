								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAITHERSBURG – Congressman John K. Delaney of Maryland’s Sixth District calls on Maryland Governor Larry Hogan and the state legislature to work together to support a full offset of any federal cuts to funding for Planned Parenthood in Maryland. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScglcInvr84c6En2P-gcOQKbNJp7IhWL1P6y1hAUL4vQCdMNg/viewform">Delaney has asked Marylanders to join him on this effort on social media.</a></p>
<p>“I’m going to fight extreme right-wing attempts to defund Planned Parenthood in Congress every step of the way,” said Delaney. “Marylanders also need the Governor to stand up for women’s health. I call on Governor Hogan to do right by Marylanders and commit to offset any cuts to Planned Parenthood.”</p>
<p>Governor Charlie Baker (R-Massachusetts) today <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/03/charlie-baker-promises-state-funding-offset-any-cuts-planned-parenthood/vRQVPpF3H7nPmbkct8kJeJ/story.html">announced</a> plans for the state government to match any funding “should the federal government pursue changes that would block care for women and families here in Massachusetts.”</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congressman John K. Delaney introduced legislation this week to reform Metro&#8217;s governance and increase federal support for WMATA. Congressman Delaney&#8217;s WMATA Improvement Act provides an additional $75 million per year in federal funding if necessary changes are made to the way WMATA is run. Delaney&#8217;s bill requires that all members of Metro&#8217;s Board of Directors be experts in safety, transportation, management or finance and that the Board of Directors certifies that the system&#8217;s labor agreements allow for improvements in performance, while maintaining key wage protections.</p>
<p><a href="https://origin-nyi.thehill.com/policy/transportation/320011-dem-introduces-bill-to-boost-dc-metro-funding">Coverage from <em>The Hill </em>here</a>:</p>
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
<div class="field-items">
<div class="field-item even">
<p><em>A Maryland Democrat is leading a House effort to boost funding for Washington’s Metrorail in exchange for a series of reforms to its labor agreements and governance structure.</em></p>
<p><em>Rep. John Delaney, who surveyed over 1,700 people about how best to upgrade the beleaguered transit system, unveiled legislation on Thursday that would give Metro an additional $75 million in annual federal funding over 10 years. D.C., Maryland and Virginia would also have to kick in a combined $75 million per year under the measure.</em></p>
<p><em>Metro is projected to face a nearly $300 million budget shortfall in fiscal 2018, as it has implemented a massive repair project in an effort to fix on-going safety issues. Congress already provides $150 million per year for Metro’s capital budget.</em></p>
<p><em>But to receive the extra cash under Delaney’s bill, the three local jurisdictions would have to reduce Metro’s board of directors from 16 members to nine, require all members to meet certain qualifications and give the general manager a seat on the board.</em></p>
<p><em>The measure also would require Metro’s collective bargaining agreement to be overhauled in a way that allows for necessary improvements “while maintaining key wage protections.”</em></p>
<p><em>If the local jurisdictions do not implement these changes within 18 months, the federal government could withdraw its consent from Metro’s Compact, which is the transit system’s founding document.</em></p>
<p><em>“This legislation removes the brakes that have held back reform for too long,” Delaney said. “We give the jurisdictions a powerful two-pronged incentive — more funding coupled with a ticking clock on the Compact — to take two necessary actions: create a world-class Board of Directors for Metro comprised of experts with a fiduciary responsibility and make sure that management-labor provisions allow the system to perform better and become safer for everyone.” </em></p>
<p><em>A D.C. business council has long advocated for Metro’s compact to be rewritten so that the transit agency can restructure its finances and governance structure.</em></p>
<p><em>“Metro is suffering from an existential problem as old as Metro itself: The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority Compact, which governs the operation of the Metro system, is fundamentally flawed,” the Federal City Council wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post last year. “It is hard to fix Metro when its member jurisdictions can veto productive changes or well-conceived management plans are not effectively executed in the field.”</em></p>
<p><em>The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/democrats-fix-for-metro-750-million-from-feds-in-exchange-for-governance-labor-changes/2017/02/16/eff41974-f46f-11e6-8d72-263470bf0401_story.html?postshare=6871487279383553&amp;tid=ss_tw&amp;utm_term=.1f8364c2eac4%20" target="_blank">Washington Post reported</a> that Virginia Republican Barbara Comstock is also preparing legislation to overhaul Metro’s Compact, but her measure will aim to extract bigger concessions from labor unions before granting any extra funding to the transit agency.</em></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAITHERSBURG – Congressman John K. Delaney has been elected to serve a third term representing Maryland’s Sixth District in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Congressman Delaney releases the following statement:</p>
<p>“We are very pleased with the results this evening and I want to thank the voters in the Sixth District for their strong support – it is both gratifying and humbling.  I want to thank April and my family for their unwavering support and for the talented and dedicated members of my team and the hundreds of volunteers who supported us this election cycle – our resounding victory was made possible because of your tremendous work.  From Accident to Aspen Hill we knocked on doors, worked the phones and fought for every vote. This is more about all of you than it is about me, truly.</p>
<p>“Our campaign message was simple; we have to put the country first, leave the divisive rhetoric behind and work together to create good jobs, expand opportunity and leave a better future for the next generation. Now that the election is over, it’s time for both parties in Congress to come together to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, invest in education, respond to climate change and support our veterans.</p>
<p>“I want to commend my opponent, Amie Hoeber, for her hard work across her entire campaign and for caring enough about our country to put her hat in the ring and run for office. That is never an easy decision.</p>
<p>“In some respects our campaign this cycle was confronted by many of the things that are wrong with politics.  We were attacked by an illegal $4 million Super PAC that was advised by the Governor’s top political operative.  These partisan headwinds made the success of our grassroots campaign even more impressive and I’m grateful to be able to go back to serve in Congress and fight to end dark, hyper-partisan money in politics.</p>
<p>“This was a hard-fought and contested race and our decisive victory speaks volumes about the country’s desire for elected officials who work hard for their constituents and who lead in a bipartisan manner.  The country wants us to work together for the common good and that’s my commitment to all of my constituents &#8211; Democrat, Republican, or Independent. Whether it’s working to improve our nation’s infrastructure, including I-270 and I-81, fighting for our veterans, strengthening Social Security, investing in education, improving the environment, creating a more competitive tax and regulatory code, or reforming the redistricting process, I will continue to analyze the facts, bring new ideas to the debate, and work in a bipartisan manner.</p>
<p>“God bless you all and thank you.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAITHERSBURG – Today, Congressman John K. Delaney campaigned across Maryland’s Sixth District, speaking with voters in Allegany, Washington, Frederick and Montgomery County. Delaney greeted voters in Cumberland at the Fort Hill vs. Allegany football game, knocked on doors with Delaney campaign volunteers in Hagerstown, and phone-banked with supporters in Frederick and Gaithersburg.</p>
<p>“The best part of campaigning is hearing from Marylanders in person and taking their concerns to Congress. Across the district our bipartisan message is resonating – creating good-paying jobs by rebuilding our infrastructure, protecting Social Security, standing up for our country’s veterans,” said Congressman Delaney. “We’re going to sprint to the finish line and fight for every vote in every zip code in the district.”</p>
<p>Recently, <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behold-a-bipartisan-congressman/2016/11/03/30de3566-a144-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html">endorsed Delaney, calling him “an original thinker and a leader.”</a> Delaney has also been <a href="https://delaneyforcongress.com/delaney-named-champion-of-the-50-by-aarp/">named a “Champion of the 50+”  by AARP</a> and <a href="https://delaneyforcongress.com/honored-to-receive-the-fiscal-hero-award/">recognized as a “Fiscal Hero” by the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a bipartisan organization aimed to promote fiscal responsibility in government</a>.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Washington Post Editorial Board first endorsed <a href="https://delaneyforcongress.com/washington-post-endorses-john-delaney-in-sixth-district-race/">Congressman John K. Delaney on October 23</a> calling the choice a “slam dunk.” Today the Post followed up with an in-depth comparison of the two candidates, issuing a strong endorsement and highlighting Rep. Delaney’s innovative legislative approach and bipartisan solutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behold-a-bipartisan-congressman/2016/11/03/30de3566-a144-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html">The editorial is as follows</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Behold, a bipartisan congressman</strong></p>
<p><strong>Washington Post Editorial Board<br />
November 3, 2016</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>MARYLAND REP. John Delaney (D) is among a tiny handful of lawmakers who have managed to surmount partisan gridlock to make a quick, positive mark in Congress. In just two terms representing the state’s 6th District, which stretches from Montgomery County to the West Virginia line, Mr. Delaney has established a reputation as one of Capitol Hill’s most substantive, proactive and bipartisan newcomers.</em></p>
<p><em>In plenty of places, Mr. Delaney, who had a successful business career before turning to politics in 2012, would be a shoo-in for reelection. But Maryland’s 6th, closely divided between Democrats and Republicans, is nobody’s safe seat. Having won a second term narrowly in 2014, Mr. Delaney faces a tough fight again this year.</em></p>
<p><em>We have endorsed him on the strength of his energetic advocacy of bipartisan legislation, including a measure that would encourage corporations to repatriate overseas earnings tax-free, in exchange for helping finance major infrastructure projects.</em></p>
<p><em>That bill, which has dozens of Republican sponsors, is one of several he conceived that attracted bipartisan backing. The nonpartisan site GovTrack <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/john_delaney/412544/report-card/2015">ranked</a> Mr. Delaney third highest for bipartisanship among all House Democrats; last year, nearly two-thirds of his bills and resolutions had both Democratic and Republican co-sponsors.</em></p>
<p><em>His Republican challenger, Amie Hoeber, a defense consultant, is the beneficiary of ample campaign cash, much of it <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/hoebers-husband-donates-another-14-million-to-super-pac-backing-her-md-congressional-campaign/2016/10/17/62aa59a4-949b-11e6-9b7c-57290af48a49_story.html">from her husband</a>. She has sought to play on voters’ anxieties by insisting they live in “an era of fear that didn’t exist a decade ago.” (Never mind the aftermath of Sept. 11 or the London bus bombings of 2005.)</em></p>
<p><em>Ms. Hoeber’s stock in trade is a trove of alarmist assertions. But her policy prescriptions are facile. She proposes to increase military spending by tens of billions of dollars, airily suggesting the funds could be gotten by cutting “<a href="http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/election_2016/md_house_senate/u-s-house-of-representatives-candidates/article_8c31074e-0ca1-5472-a21a-8f948eb914b1.html">duplicative programs</a>” she does not name. Just as implausibly, she says Metro, facing huge deficits and infrastructure projects, can solve its problems without more revenue. </em></p>
<p><em>Meanwhile, like many in the GOP, Ms. Hoeber has found herself in a morass of hypocrisy regarding Donald Trump, whom, as a loyal Republican, she backs as a “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/gop-challenger-aimee-hoeber-aims-to-upend-john-delaney-in-mds-6th-district/2016/10/02/ed82eed2-8416-11e6-ac72-a29979381495_story.html">matter of honor</a>.” Where is the honor for Ms. Hoeber, who <a href="http://www.bethesdamagazine.com/Bethesda-Beat/Web-2016/First-Candidate-Forum-Reveals-Kinder-Gentler-Side-of-Heated-District-6-Contest/">boasts of</a> mentoring young women and fighting gender discrimination and domestic abuse, in supporting a leering misogynist who has publicly objectified women for decades and stands accused of groping and assaulting them?</em></p>
<p><em>Ms. Hoeber is a standard-issue partisan with no fresh ideas; Mr. Delaney is an original thinker and a leader. The district would be well served by reelecting him.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAITHERSBURG – Congressman John K. Delaney has been endorsed by the National Education Association (NEA) in Maryland’s Sixth District. The Maryland State Education Association (MSEA, which represents over 72,000 Maryland educators and school employees, is the state affiliate of the NEA in Maryland. <a href="https://delaneyforcongress.com/delaney-authors-legislation-to-create-nationwide-pre-k-for-all/">Delaney is the author of legislation to give all parents the option of enrolling their children in free high-quality pre-k</a> and <a href="http://www.heraldmailmedia.com/news/local/delaney-makes-a-statement-with-infrastructure-bill/article_5393c94e-8892-11e4-9e52-9ba38f882a77.html">Delaney’s infrastructure bill includes education, providing state and local governments with more resources to build and renovate schools.</a></p>
<p>“I’m honored to be endorsed by MSEA and to stand with them in fighting for Maryland students,” said Congressman Delaney. “Supporting and sustaining great schools is about maximizing the potential of every kid, but also about positioning our country to succeed in the high-tech, high-skill global economy of the future. Education changed my life and I look forward to continuing to work with the great educators we have here in Maryland.”</p>
<p>“John Delaney shares the values of our members and shares their commitment to quality education for all,” said Kent County teacher and MSEA President Betty Weller. “John Delaney is the clear choice in the Sixth District race, a leader who is bringing new ideas to Washington and is an advocate for students in every zip code. While Amie Hoeber has offered extreme Tea Party rhetoric on education, John Delaney has a proven record and is someone that Maryland parents, educators and students need in Congress.”</p>
<p><em>The NEA Fund for Children and Public Education, the NEA’s national political action committee, provides direct financial support to candidates for president, U.S. House, and U.S. Senate who will fight to support teachers, staff, and students and improve public education. MSEA—the state affiliate of NEA—represents more than 72,000 educators, making it the largest union and professional association in Maryland. MSEA members are a well-known presence on Election Day, as thousands mobilize to promote endorsed candidates at polling places across Maryland with the Apple Ballot.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>GAITHERSBURG – A television ad featuring Congressman John K. Delaney’s bipartisan work to create jobs, rebuild America’s infrastructure and protect Social Security has begun airing in Maryland’s Sixth District. The spot highlights Delaney’s experience working with his father, a union electrician who passed away this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jNlPZW8lo08">The ad is available online here</a>.</p>
<p>John grew up in a blue-collar household and thanks to a scholarship from his father’s union became a leading entrepreneur in Maryland. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/two-years-later-out-of-the-box-idea-gains-traction-on-capitol-hill/2015/02/07/08b602a6-ad73-11e4-ad71-7b9eba0f87d6_story.html">Delaney is the author of the largest bipartisan infrastructure bill in Congress</a>, which uses revenues from international tax reform to rebuild America’s infrastructure. <a href="http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/otps/pubs/impacts/">Using job creation estimates from the United States Department of Transportation</a>, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/625">Delaney’s infrastructure plan</a> would create over one million new jobs. <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/208252-bipartisan-bill-would-establish-social-security-commission">Delaney has worked with Republican Congressman Tom Cole to introduce bipartisan legislation</a> to make Social Security secure for the next 75 years. The Delaney-Cole bill has been filed each of the last two Congresses. Delaney has been named a <a href="https://delaneyforcongress.com/delaney-named-champion-of-the-50-by-aarp/">Champion of the 50+ from the AARP</a> and a <a href="http://www.wfmd.com/2016/05/27/rep-delaney-honored-as-fiscal-hero/">Fiscal Hero by the Committee to Fix the Debt.</a></p>
<p>The script of the ad, titled “Collaboration” is as follows:</p>
<p><em>This was my dad’s pickup – he was a union electrician.</em></p>
<p><em>I grew up working on his jobsites where he taught me the value of hard work and teamwork.  </em></p>
<p><em>That’s how I built two businesses from scratch right here in Maryland and created thousands of jobs.  </em></p>
<p><em>In Congress, I work across party lines – from rebuilding roads to creating jobs and to strengthening Social Security.  </em></p>
<p><em>Roll up your sleeves and work with others.</em></p>
<p><em>That’s what my dad did, and it’s what I’ll keep doing in Congress.</em></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Washington Jewish Week</em> has endorsed John Delaney in the Sixth District race. <a href="http://washingtonjewishweek.com/34168/for-congress-raskin-delaney-and-brown/editorial-opinion/editorial/">In an editorial published on October 26</a>, the editors write:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In the sixth congressional district, Democrat John Delaney is running for his third term in a highly competitive race against Republican Amie Hoeber. Green Party candidate George Gluck is also running.</em></p>
<p><em>Delaney has compiled a liberal record in his four years in Congress. He voted for the Iran nuclear agreement and against the lifting of sanctions on Iran. He voted to override President Obama’s veto of a bill that would permit American victims of terrorism abroad to sue foreign countries in U.S. courts. And he has been a solid, reliable friend of the State of Israel.</em></p>
<p><em>Delaney has also received high ratings from conservation groups. He authored legislation to fight climate change and is co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill to create a commission for climate solutions. He has been a champion of rebuilding the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges, activity that if funded will result in thousands of jobs.</em></p>
<p><em>Hoeber was deputy undersecretary of the Army during the Reagan administration. Gov. Larry Hogan has been stumping for her. But unlike the popular governor, she supports Donald Trump for president. Her conservative positions include limiting the scope of the federal government, rebuilding the military and reducing taxes. Hoeber won an 85 percent rating from the National Rifle Association.</em></p>
<p><em>We question Hoeber’s judgment, and find her too conservative for our tastes; Delaney should be returned to Congress.</em></p></blockquote>
