								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>“As your President, I won’t walk out of an infrastructure meeting with Congressional leaders and act like a spoiled child; I will roll up my sleeves and do what my dad the electrician did his whole life, get to work and start building things &#8211; big things &#8211; again.”</em><br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Today, John Delaney releases his $2 trillion Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive set of policies to address the nation’s infrastructure crisis. Delaney’s plan includes rebuilding our roads and bridges, rebuilding water systems, boosting climate resiliency, and investing in communities left behind. The plan is fully paid for. According to the Washington Post, “[t]he shoddy state of the nation’s roads cost the average driver $515 in extra operation and maintenance costs. [T]wenty-eight percent of the nation’s major roadways &#8212; interstates, freeways and major arterial roadways in urban areas – are in ‘poor’ condition.”<br><br>Delaney’s plan increases the size of the Highway Trust Fund and creates seven new infrastructure funds:</p>



<ol><li>A National Infrastructure Bank</li><li>A Climate Resiliency Fund</li><li>A Water Infrastructure Matching Fund</li><li>A School Infrastructure Matching Fund</li><li>Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund&nbsp;</li><li>Rural Broadband Matching Fund</li><li>An Areas Left Behind Matching Fund</li></ol>



<p>“There are no easy answers to many of our economic issues but there are simple answers, including launching a massive, job-creating, community improving infrastructure program to rebuild our roads and bridges, extend rural broadband, improve decaying water systems, and build the advanced energy economy,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong>  “As the author of the largest bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Congress, I know how to get this done.  <br><br>“My $2 trillion infrastructure program is fully paid for and will transform our entire country and allow us to dream big again as a nation.  As your President, I won’t walk out of an infrastructure meeting with Congressional leaders and act like a spoiled child; I will roll up my sleeves and do what my dad the electrician did his whole life, get to work and start building things &#8211; big things &#8211; again.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><br><strong>Delaney’s Infrastructure Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Investment in infrastructure is long overdue as spending on infrastructure in relation to GDP has steadily dropped over the past several decades, with most funding coming from state and local governments. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the U.S. a D+ average on our infrastructure. Not only is infrastructure funding necessary to improve the system, investing in rebuilding crumbling infrastructure is a job creator and will boost the economy. Infrastructure has the second highest return on investment for the government.<br><br>Delaney will pay for his plan by raising the corporate tax rate to 27% and increasing the federal gas tax to account for inflation since the last increase and indexing it for inflation going forward. Projects supported through Delaney’s infrastructure plan will be governed by federal labor protections including paying workers prevailing wages.<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Bank</strong><br>Delaney has been an ardent supporter of the need to create an Infrastructure Bank. While in Congress, he introduced bipartisan legislation that would create an Infrastructure Bank to make it easier and cheaper for states and local governments to invest in local infrastructure in the categories of transportation, water, energy, communications, and school facilities. As part of his infrastructure plan, Delaney proposes capitalizing an Infrastructure Bank with $50 billion which can leverage $750 billion of infrastructure projects around the country while encouraging public-private partnerships.<br></li><li><strong>Highway Trust Fund</strong><br>American roads and mass transit have been systematically underfunded which has led to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) giving our roads a D on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/" target="_blank">annual report card</a> with mass transit receiving a D-. Not only does the Highway Trust Fund, the main source of federal funding for roads and mass transit, struggle to remain solvent but the current level of funding still leaves massive shortfalls in meeting total needs for surface transportation. To address these deficiencies, Delaney proposes increasing the HTF with a one-time boost of $200 billion, bringing the Fund to almost $850 billion over the next 10 years. It is paid for by retroactively indexing the gas tax to inflation and by raising the corporate tax rate to 27%. <strong>Delaney’s plan will increase direct investment by the Highway Trust Fund by 50% over the next decade.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Climate Infrastructure Fund</strong><br>Climate change has led to more frequent and dangerous storms, which have resulted in widespread damage across the country. These storms have had devastating effects including increased forest fires and flooding. What meteorologists deem as 100- year floods have been occurring with more frequency, leading to widespread destruction to land, people’s homes, and public infrastructure. Recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2019/05/15/iowa-flooding-levee-repairs-leave-riverside-communities-stressed/3678703002/" target="_blank">in Iowa when the levees broke</a> along the Missouri River, communities were flooded resulting in billions of dollars in damage and forcing people from their homes.  We also need to make our energy transmission systems more efficient to better conserve energy and avoid waste.<br><br>We need to invest in and improve climate resilient infrastructure to protect communities against the effects of climate change, which is why Delaney proposes the creation of a $60 billion Climate Infrastructure Fund that will allow state and local governments to invest in and prioritize projects that will expand and improve climate resilient infrastructure in addition to improving energy efficiency in our systems. This will also pay for Delaney’s previously announced Carbon Throughway, an infrastructure project that will transport captured carbon from the Midwest for permanent sequestration and reuse in the Permian Basin.<br><br>In addition to the Infrastructure Bank, increasing the Highway Trust Fund, and increasing funding for climate infrastructure, Delaney proposes creating five funds that match state and local investments 4:1 in specific categories.<br></li><li><strong>Water Infrastructure Matching Fund</strong><br>While cracked roads and bridges are readily apparent to anyone who looks around, equally important infrastructure exists below ground that we can’t see.  Around the country, too many cities are suffering from poor water quality and crumbling water systems. The crisis in Flint, Michigan is just one tragic example of the serious health effects of not ensuring that every American has access to clean water. Aging water systems have led to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Drinking-Water-Final.pdf" target="_blank">nearly six billion gallons</a> of treated drinking water lost daily due to leaking pipes. ASCE rated American water infrastructure a D while wastewater received a D+.  In addition, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/ports/" target="_blank">American ports and harbors have been underinvested in</a>, even while they facilitate almost 99% of overseas trade and are responsible for $4.6 trillion in economic activity. To facilitate changes in shipping and the size of the ships, ports need continued investment to modernize and maintain operability.  <br><br>To address the insufficient focus on water infrastructure, Delaney proposes supplementing WIFIA and the existing state revolving funds with the creation of a new $40 billion Water Infrastructure Matching Fund to allow state and local governments to have dedicated funding to invest in ports and harbors and fix aging water systems to ensure a Flint water crisis never happens again.<br></li><li><strong>School Infrastructure Matching Fund</strong><br>In too many districts, America’s public schools are overcrowded and outdated. Public school buildings on average are more than 40 years old, and s<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/ports/" target="_blank">tructural deficiencies in school buildings are associated with poor health and decreased academic performance</a>.  No child should have to attend school without adequate air conditioning, with crumbling ceilings, or with drinking fountains with water too contaminated to drink. Delaney’s $40 billion School Infrastructure Matching Fund will allow state and local governments to build new schools to keep pace with growing populations and to make necessary improvements to existing facilities.<br></li><li><strong>Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund</strong><br>Years of partisanship and government gridlock have meant that we only address major infrastructure problems through expensive new projects or in response to a crisis or an emergency. We need to confront the deferred maintenance needs of existing infrastructure to keep systems in good repair and prevent disasters. Demand is growing for freight and passenger rail capacity, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rail-Final.pdf" target="_blank">our current system is ridden with maintenance backlogs on projects</a> with an average age of 111 years. In addition, there are more than 47,000 structurally deficient bridges in the US, and at the current rate of maintenance work it would take <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artbabridgereport.org/" target="_blank">more than 80 years</a> to make the needed repairs. Delaney will address this problem by creating a $40 billion Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund to assist states and municipalities in taking care of the infrastructure we already have.<br></li><li><strong>Areas Left Behind Matching Fund</strong><br>State governments have limited capacity for new infrastructure projects and face significant financial constraints, which means that projects in prosperous areas often receive priority while disadvantaged communities can have their needs neglected. Lack of investment is a problem for both urban and rural communities. Struggling urban neighborhoods need robust transit networks, like the canceled Red Line light rail project that would have served inner-city Baltimore, and rural communities have transportation infrastructure needs, including bridges and tunnels, that are passed over in favor of larger projects in more populous areas. We need to consider the cost of not investing in struggling communities and to address the persistent funding gap. To encourage states to invest in the infrastructure needs of economically-distressed communities, Delaney will create a $40 billion matching fund dedicated to projects in areas that have been left behind.<br></li><li><strong>Rural Broadband Matching Fund </strong><br>Access to high-speed, reliable broadband is a necessity in the 21st century. Communities rely on it for employment and academic opportunities and to connect people to telemedicine providers. However, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2016-broadband-progress-report" target="_blank">almost 40% of those in rural areas lack access to reliable broadband</a>, putting them at a disadvantage to the rest of the country. To close the gap and ensure rural America has access to the necessary technology, Delaney will create a $40 billion Rural Broadband Matching Fund dedicated to building broadband infrastructure.<br></li></ol>

<p><strong>Delaney Campaign Highlights&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Policy&nbsp;Focus</strong></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD –&nbsp;</strong>According to multiple analysts and pundits,&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;has not played a large role in the Democratic primary to date.<br><br><strong>John Delaney’s National Press Secretary, Michael Starr Hopkins, releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“There has been commentary in the media in recent days concerning lack of attention to&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues among Democratic presidential candidates.</p>



<p>“That is not the case with the Delaney for President 2020 Campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“John Delaney considers&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;as the unique area in which the President of the United States has grave responsibility and clear authority to defend the interests of the United States and to represent the United States in the global community.&nbsp; He places high priority on covering all&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy issues and stands prepared to assume the responsibility of managing our country’s&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;affairs and national defense from the first hour of his presidency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Delaney Campaign appointed a&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Policy&nbsp;Coordinator in November 2018 and has developed a network&nbsp;from prestigious think tanks&nbsp;and universities&nbsp;of&nbsp;about 250 experts on more than thirty&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues from whom we draw for private one-on-one meetings and roundtable discussions. We have prioritized regular foreign policy briefings from experts in the field on those important issues.&nbsp; These consultations will continue until Inauguration Day 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Congressman Delaney delivered <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/05/01/talking-foreign-policy-at-johns-hopkins-sais/">a comprehensive speech</a> at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies on April 30, 2019, in which he presented the key elements of his foreign policy agenda. Delaney’s focus on foreign policy was also highlighted in Josh Rogin’s May 23<sup>rd</sup><br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/2020-democrats-must-run-on-foreign-policy-not-away-from-it/2019/05/23/e08775cc-7d88-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.465b5782c485">column</a> in <em>The Washington Post, </em>titled ‘2020 Democrats must run on foreign policy, not away from it.’<br><br>“During the duration of the 2020 presidential campaign Congressman Delaney will continue to share his vision for foreign policy and America&#8217;s responsibility as a leader in our global community.”</p>



<p>Delaney is scheduled to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday, September 5, 2019 in New York.</p>

<h4><em>Delaney attending holiday events in New Hampshire on Memorial Day</em></h4>



<p> </p>



<p><strong>CHARLESTOWN, NH</strong> – John Delaney is attending Memorial Day events in Charlestown, Bow, and Portsmouth New Hampshire this holiday. <br><br>Delaney releases the following statement:<br><br>“Memorial Day is one of the most sacred days on the calendar, a day to reflect and remember. Today we honor the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending the country they loved, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us, we honor those who fought to keep our nation safe and free, and we are forever in their debt. </p>



<p>“At Memorial Day events across the country today, we see evidence that there is much more that unites us than divides us. The fallen that we remember today came from every town and city, from every background, from every faith, and the heroism, bravery, and service of those we honor today set an example for all of us. Finally, today is a powerful reminder that we must do everything we can to support our veterans and military families and make sure that their sacrifice is recognized and they receive the benefits they have earned.” </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, in a column in <em>The Washington Post</em> titled “2020 Democrats must run on foreign policy, not away from it,” Josh Rogin highlighted John Delaney’s foreign policy focus and expertise. Rogin writes that while most Democratic presidential candidates have “remained quiet” on foreign policy, “one exception has been former Maryland congressman John Delaney.” Rogin continues, “Delaney is running as an unabashed internationalist, centrist, moderate Democrat who believes in returning to the assertive, values-promoting, alliance-building foreign policy approach that majorities in both parties once traditionally supported.”<br><br>The piece comes after Delaney <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/05/01/talking-foreign-policy-at-johns-hopkins-sais/">laid out his detailed vision</a> for foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.<br><br>To read the piece online, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/2020-democrats-must-run-on-foreign-policy-not-away-from-it/2019/05/23/e08775cc-7d88-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.b85354d33052">click here</a>.<br><br><br><br><strong>The Washington Post </strong><br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/2020-democrats-must-run-on-foreign-policy-not-away-from-it/2019/05/23/e08775cc-7d88-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.b85354d33052"><strong>2020 Democrats must run on foreign policy, not away from it</strong></a><br>By Josh Rogin<br>5/23/19<br><br>The conventional wisdom on presidential elections is that foreign policy doesn’t play a decisive role — and most Democratic presidential candidates have largely avoided it, so far. But in the 2020 presidential contest, foreign policy will feature more prominently than ever, and Democrats ignore it at their own peril.</p>



<p>In 2016, voters had a clear choice between a traditional foreign policy leader with tons of experience in Hillary Clinton vs. a candidate with no foreign policy experience who promised to radically change the way U.S. diplomacy was conducted. Although&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nbc-wsj-polling-shows-clinton-foreign-policy-advantage-n584536">polls showed</a>&nbsp;voters trusted Clinton more as a commander in chief, she lost the election, and President Trump has been implementing his new vision for the United States’ role in the world ever since.</p>



<p>That’s been a mix of what Trump calls “nationalism”: a pivot away from values-based foreign policy advocacy, an embrace of populism abroad, support for authoritarian rulers, skepticism of international organizations such as NATO, and unilateralism in confronting threats such as Iran and the rise of China.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/poll-trump-foreign-policy-approval-rating-2020-8cea6883-ce3f-477b-8006-91fb66cec8c8.html">new poll this week&nbsp;</a>by the Democratic group&nbsp;<a href="https://nationalsecurityaction.org/">National Security Action</a>&nbsp;showed that Trump is vulnerable on foreign policy, even among his own supporters, especially when it comes to trade and Russia. And yet, Democratic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/2020-presidential-hopefuls/">presidential candidates</a>&nbsp;— with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-candidates-aren-t-talking-about-foreign-policy-why-cone-n1007131">a couple of exceptions</a>&nbsp;— have remained quiet on these issues.</p>



<p>One exception has been former Maryland congressman John Delaney. He has been talking to voters about foreign policy since becoming the first Democratic candidate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-delaney-why-im-running-for-president/2017/07/28/02460ae4-73b7-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.2db18945c2ae">to declare his candidacy</a>&nbsp;in July 2017. He is convinced it’s the most important 2020 issue.</p>



<p>“Foreign policy is the biggest part of the job. And that’s the irony of running for president,” he told me during an interview.</p>



<p>Delaney is running as an unabashed internationalist, centrist, moderate Democrat who believes in returning to the assertive, values-promoting, alliance-building foreign policy approach that majorities in both parties once traditionally supported. This month, he laid out a detailed agenda during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/05/01/talking-foreign-policy-at-johns-hopkins-sais/">a speech</a>&nbsp;at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced and International Studies.</p>



<p>The Center for American Progress&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/05/05/469218/america-adrift/">released a study</a>&nbsp;this month that showed Democratic voters do care about foreign policy, though they want to hear about how it relates to their security and prosperity — not about “maintaining the liberal international order.”</p>



<p>Delaney argues foreign policy is more intertwined than ever with economics and prosperity at home, and that Trump has co-opted the legitimate grievances of those left behind by globalization to advance his unilateralist, nationalist, populist agenda. But Delaney believes Democratic primary voters can be persuaded to fix the system rather than blow it up.</p>



<p>“The world has changed very rapidly and profoundly and we didn’t do the kind of things we should have done to prepare our citizens for this. As a result, a lot of them feel left behind and their response is to question everything,” he said. “The American people will allow you to think globally as long as they believe you are investing locally.”</p>



<p>Also, Democratic primary voters object to the way the president conducts himself on the world stage, Delaney said. Values, decency and morality are now foreign policy issues, as well.</p>



<p>That basic frame of a return to normalcy in foreign policy is similar to what the Democratic front-runner, former vice president Joe Biden, is running on, as well. But Biden has yet to articulate a specific foreign policy agenda, and when talking about China, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-dismisses-china-threat-again">he has stumbled</a>.</p>



<p>The two progressive candidates most active on foreign policy are Sens.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/bernie-sanders-imagines-a-progressive-new-approach-to-foreign-policy">Bernie Sanders</a>&nbsp;(I-Vt.) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/11/29/elizabeth-warren-foreign-policy-speech-american-university">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;(D-Mass.). They both want the Democratic Party to pursue a more progressive, less-interventionist, less-capitalist foreign policy that would represent a wholesale change, as opposed to the tweaks centrists are proposing.</p>



<p>The fault lines that would emerge if the Democratic primary did turn to a foreign policy focus are clear: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade war with China, Israel, Venezuela, Iran, defense spending and perhaps Russia. The Democratic leadership in Congress has an interest in papering over these differences. When interparty differences emerge on Israel, for example, Republicans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apnews.com/86aaea07c97f4dd5a537b1031d1fb295">are quick to pounce</a>.</p>



<p>Delaney argues that Trump’s nationalist tendencies and the negative results have pushed Democratic voters back toward a more centrist, traditional foreign policy position.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/blue-dog-democrats-are-poised-to-play-a-crucial-role-in-the-next-congress/2018/12/13/4d8168ae-ff1c-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html?utm_term=.28a3ce22156f">It’s a fact</a>&nbsp;that more centrist Democrat national security candidates were elected during the midterm elections in 2018 than progressives.</p>



<p>“We were trending towards isolationism as a party, in many ways. But Trump’s brand of nationalism is being rejected by many Democratic primary voters,” Delaney said. “That’s a positive step for the party.”</p>



<p>The truth is, we don’t know which foreign policy Democratic voters favor because they haven’t been presented with a clear and honest choice. In 2020, foreign policy will be on the minds of all Americans, and if Democratic presidential candidates don’t engage in the debate, they will lose it.</p>

<h4><em>“This is a real plan that all Americans can support.”</em></h4>



<p></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney announces today the release of his $4 trillion Climate Change Plan, a comprehensive roadmap of policy solutions to address the climate change crisis. Delaney’s Climate Change plan focuses on six areas:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>A Carbon Fee and Dividend&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Direct Air Capture/Negative Emissions Technology (NET)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increasing Renewable Energy Research Budget 5-Fold</strong></li><li><strong>Challenge Grants</strong></li><li><strong>A Climate Corps</strong></li><li><strong>A Carbon Throughway</strong><br>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>“We have to act on climate and we have to act now,” <strong>said Congressman John Delaney</strong>. “Failure to act threatens our prosperity, national security, food supply, and the natural world. We can’t wait to convince the climate deniers and we can’t put forth unrealistic solutions or plans that crush Americans economically. We need a real plan to hit our goals and we have to listen to actual scientists. This is a real plan that all Americans can support. It is full of new ideas and massive investments in innovation that will both deal with climate change and create jobs in the heartland and all across our country.  This will be a first 100 days priority in my administration.</p>



<p>“We have to leave the world better than we found it and we won&#8217;t do that unless we stop global warming. My administration will make rural and heartland America the center of a massive new industry – carbon capture.”</p>



<p>Congressman Delaney is serious about tackling climate change and was awarded the Climate Leadership Award by the Citizens Climate Lobby in 2017. While in Congress, Delaney introduced the first bipartisan carbon fee and dividend bill in a decade.  <br></p>



<h4 style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Climate Plan</strong></h4>



<p>John Delaney is serious about tackling climate change.  It’s a big problem and it requires big solutions, which is why Delaney is announcing his $4 trillion Climate Plan that is full of new ideas and innovative solutions.<br><br>According to the IPCC, limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We are already seeing the early effects of climate change, and that level of rapid emissions reductions is necessary to avoid the catastrophic consequences that would result from any further delay. The difference between the warming we have already experienced and the 2°C warming we could see if we don’t act now to reduce emissions is a greater risk of water scarcity, increased sea-level rise, greater damage to ecosystems and animal habitats, declines in human health, and the displacement of millions of people. In addition to the environmental effects, the Department of Defense has characterized climate change as a threat multiplier. Delaney’s plan will put us on the right track to reduce emissions in time to avoid the worst consequences of global warming.<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Carbon Fee and Dividend</strong><br>The largest component of Delaney’s climate plan that will have the biggest impact is his Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal. It is time we put a price on carbon to end polluters’ free ride. While in Congress, Delaney introduced the first bipartisan Carbon Fee and Dividend bill in over 10 years. The proposal starts the fee at $15 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent and increases the cost by $10 each year. Implementing a carbon fee, where the revenue is returned to the American people, is the best method for providing the market incentives to reduce our emissions. Delaney’s Carbon Fee will reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2050. Taxpayers would also be given options with what to do with the dividend, including investing in a tax-advantaged savings account like a 529 for future education purposes or a retirement account. The Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal has bipartisan support from various industries in the private sector as well as the environmental community. However, we need more innovative solutions that will get us to net-zero emissions by 2050.<br></li><li><strong>Direct Air Capture/Negative Emissions Technology (NET)</strong><br>Reducing new carbon emissions and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not be enough to limit global warming. According to the IPCC, to achieve net zero emissions and prevent warming in excess of 1.5°C we will need Negative Emissions Technology, including direct air capture, to remove a minimum of 100 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. This technology is currently too expensive to be implemented at the necessary scale, which is why Delaney proposes ending the federal government’s fossil fuel subsidies and making an annual $5 billion investment in NET.   <br> &#8211; Delaney will promote NET, thus bringing down the cost, through a reverse auction program that gives first access to government subsidies to the companies that can capture and store atmospheric carbon for the lowest cost. <br>&#8211; By promoting innovation in NET and implementing the carbon fee, Delaney will create a powerful financial incentive to capture carbon instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. As emitting carbon becomes more expensive due to the increasing carbon fee, it will be more economical to capture the carbon and avoid paying the fee.<br></li><li><strong>Increasing Renewable Energy Research Budget 5-Fold</strong><br>We will solve climate change the American way, innovating our way out of the problem. This will require continued robust government support. Delaney proposes a 5-fold increase in DOE green energy programs, including the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and the Office of Nuclear Energy. This investment will support research to improve energy storage, battery performance, sustainable transportation technology, grid efficiency, renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, and energy conservation technology.<br><br>To continue private sector investment in the renewable energy economy, Delaney will bolster renewable energy tax credits.<br> </li><li><strong>Challenge Grants</strong><br>To spur climate change innovation in the private and non-profit sectors, Delaney will create a new challenge grant program for significant innovations in:<br>&#8211; Preventing and stopping wildfires<br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from agriculture <br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from manufacturing <br>&#8211; Electrification of freight <br>&#8211; Energy storage and transmission<br> </li><li><strong>Climate Corps</strong><br>Delaney proposed the creation of the Climate Corps as part of his National Service Program. The new program would provide opportunities for recent high school graduates to work in low-income urban and rural communities where the Corps members would support these communities’ transition to a green economy, work on environmentally friendly projects, and fight climate change by working on the ground. Under-resourced communities for too long have suffered the most from pollution and climate change, all too often lacking clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. We must provide the manpower and resources to support these communities and recognize that all Americans have a right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment.<br> <br>In partnership with the government, community-based organizations, and local businesses, Climate Corps members can help communities:<br>&#8211; Identify the most pressing local needs that are hindering the community from transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices <br>&#8211; Provide information and support to families about sustainability, energy efficiency, and renewable energy <br>&#8211; Assist in clean energy projects including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices<br> </li><li><strong>Carbon Throughway</strong><br>Climate change skeptics often invoke the false choice of having to choose between jobs or the environment; we can create jobs AND fight climate change at the same time. That’s where the Carbon Throughway comes in.<br><br>The Carbon Throughway is a $20 billion infrastructure project that we will construct to safely transport captured CO<sub>2</sub> to sites for permanent sequestration and reuse. Building the Carbon Throughway will create tens of thousands of jobs and spur new R&amp;D and innovation in carbon capture. The project would be built with federal labor protections using American steel under a project labor agreement and pay workers prevailing wages. To the extent possible, the Throughway will be built along right of ways of existing pipelines and always abide by the strictest environmental standards. As the carbon fee raises the price of releasing emissions and new innovations in NET make carbon capture cost-effective, the Carbon Throughway will provide an additional financial incentive to capture carbon by facilitating its transfer for commercial uses and permanent sequestration.<br> </li></ol>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– In response to President Trump’s refusal to work with Democrats until the completion of&nbsp;congressional investigations, presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:<br><br>“The President’s decision to not work with Democrats is just another example in the long line of temper tantrums coming from the White House. Bipartisan solutions are the only way that we can pass meaningful legislation that will improve the lives of all Americans. President Trump’s failure to reach across party lines will hurt every American town with a failing bridge, every teacher hoping for broadband internet in her rural school, and every parent in places like Flint, praying for help from Washington. Democrats have a responsibility to investigate the President’s improper behavior.&nbsp; To hold up bipartisan action that will help the American people for your own self-interested reasons is fundamentally unpatriotic.”</p>

In response, John Delaney released the following statement:<br> <br>“Congressman Amash is a principled conservative, and I admire the fact that he speaks his beliefs. He is certainly not the only Republican who believes that the President has obstructed justice, undermines the separation of powers, or otherwise engages in highly inappropriate behavior; but he is one of the few who takes a stand. It is time for principled Republicans to similarly take a stand and defend the Constitution, the institutions of government, the rule of law, and the norms of our society.<br><br>“If we continue to allow this President to be unchecked and manipulate the truth, we will forever alter our Democracy for the worse.”<br> ###</td></tr></tbody></table>

American farmers have suffered immensely under the President’s trade war with China and every cent of precious taxpayer money needs to be used to deliver the most positive impacts for American farmers and workers. It is clear that the Trump Administration has been one of the worst administrations for farmers, from tearing up the TPP to engaging in a ‘go it alone’ trade war. The buck stops with the President and he must be held accountable.”</p>
