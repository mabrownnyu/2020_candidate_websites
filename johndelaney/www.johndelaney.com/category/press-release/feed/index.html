<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD – </strong>Yesterday, at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Hall of Fame dinner, presidential candidate John Delaney <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1137867847609327616" target="_blank">called for the creation of a universal health care system</a> that preserves private insurance options.<br></p>



<p><strong>John Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“Some in my party are rejecting opportunities for real progress around common sense solutions by disparagingly labeling these ideas as ‘middle-ground.’&nbsp;<strong>This is fundamentally dishonest.&nbsp;</strong>First, if we learned anything from the midterm elections it is the fact that moderate candidates flipped seats from red to blue by talking about common sense solutions, not purity tests. Second, purity tests are bad public policy because they stifle debate, lead to intellectually dishonest solutions, and bad ideas, which will lead to the reelection of Donald Trump<br><br><strong>“Senator Sanders’ Medicare-for-all plan makes for a good talking point but is in fact bad policy and bad politics.&nbsp;</strong>Americans don’t want Donald Trump or Mike Pence having a say in or controlling everyone’s health care benefits, which would happen if we had a single-payer system.&nbsp;Americans want choices and they want us to continue to improve health care quality.&nbsp;My plan, BetterCare, creates universal health care by providing every American government run health insurance, keeps&nbsp;the private market in place for any American who likes their insurance and want choices, and ensures robust investment in health care.&nbsp;It’s not just smart politics, but its smart policy and it is what most countries do with universal healthcare.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Delaney’s remarks about his universal health care plan from the Hall of Fame dinner are transcribed below:</strong><br><br>“But most importantly, we need a president who is committed to creating universal health care in the United States of America. Where everyone gets health care as a basic right of citizenship. No Americans should be worried about whether they can pay for their insulin. Or worry about their children&#8217;s health care, or worry about whether if they make a decision to get health care that they may be signing up to bankrupt themselves. No American should worry about that, and we know we can do this.<br><br>“Why do we know that? Because other countries have done it. France has a universal health care system, Sweden has a universal health care system, the Netherlands has a universal health care system, and Germany has a universal health care system, so we can build a universal health care system in the wealthiest nation in the world.<br><br>“But the one thing, the one thing, about all of those countries whose systems we admire, none of them have a single-payer universal health care system, which shows there are lots of ways of creating universal health care in this country.<br><br>“My plan, BetterCare, gives every American health care as a right. It invests in our communities and ensures we have high-quality health care. It puts money against basic research so we can cure cancer and cure Alzheimer&#8217;s. And it gives the American people what they want, which is choices. That&#8217;s the best way forward on universal health care.”<br></p>

<p><strong>DES MOINES, IA</strong>– Today, at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Hall of Fame dinner, John Delaney spoke on the need to build a big tent coalition that is able to govern effectively. Delaney also emphasized the need to create a universal health care system that provides health care as a right of citizenship while preserving private insurance options. <br><br>Delaney’s plan for universal health care includes steps to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/prescription-drugs/">lower prescription drug prices</a> and improve access to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/mental-health/">mental health care</a>. The full plan can be found online<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/"> here</a>.<br><br>Delaney has also released comprehensive policy platforms to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/climate-change/">combat climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/gun-safety/">reduce gun violence</a>, <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/infrastructure/">rebuild America’s infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/heartland-fair-deal/">revitalize rural America</a>.<br><br><br><strong>Delaney’s remarks are transcribed below:</strong><br><br>So, I have been everywhere. Good afternoon, Iowa. How&#8217;s everyone doing? All right, good. So one of the great privileges of traveling to all 99 counties is that I&#8217;ve seen so many familiar faces here this afternoon and it has been great to talk to you, particularly in rural Iowa, and don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that rural Iowa doesn&#8217;t matter anymore because I think it does &#8211; there you go &#8211; and talk about how we build the big tent Democratic Party that we need to win and govern.<br><br>So I stand before you as someone who has lived the American dream and I am so grateful for all the opportunities this country has given me. To be the first in my family to go to college, to be a successful entrepreneur, to serve my country in the Congress of the United States, and most importantly, to be blessed with an amazing family.<br><br>But these stories are so much harder for young people today. Why? Because we stopped doing our job. We stopped doing the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for the future. I stand before you here today as someone who does not believe that what hard-working Americans need is more ideology, more gridlock, or more partisanship. They need solutions, and maybe that&#8217;s because of where I&#8217;m from. They do. And maybe that&#8217;s because of where I&#8217;m from.<br><br>My dad was a union electrician &#8211; IBEW. He wired buildings for a living. He did honest work. And when you do honest work, you get a building that works. You flip on a switch, the lights go on, you turn on a faucet, the water comes out. One of the problems with our president is he doesn&#8217;t build anything. He doesn&#8217;t care if anything works. He only cares about himself. We need to ensure that America works for hard-working Americans. We do.<br><br>We need to elect a president who’s committed to investing and improving public education in this country. We need to elect a president who is committed to combating climate change, to reforming our broken immigration system, to investing in all communities, including rural America, and with dealing with all of the change that&#8217;s coming from technology.<br><br>But most importantly, we need a president who is committed to creating universal health care in the United States of America. Where everyone gets health care as a basic right of citizenship. No Americans should be worried about whether they can pay for their insulin. Or worry about their children&#8217;s health care, or worry about whether if they make a decision to get health care that they may be signing up to bankrupt themselves. No American should worry about that, and we know we can do this.<br><br>Why do we know that? Because other countries have done it. France has a universal health care system, Sweden has a universal health care system, the Netherlands has a universal health care system, and Germany has a universal health care system, so we can build a universal health care system in the wealthiest nation in the world.<br><br>But the one thing, the one thing, about all of those countries whose systems we admire, none of them have a single-payer universal health care system, which shows there are lots of ways of creating universal health care in this country.<br><br>My plan, Bettercare, gives every American health care as a right. It invests in our communities and ensures we have high-quality health care. It puts money against basic research so we can cure cancer and cure Alzheimer&#8217;s. And it gives the American people what they want, which is choices. That&#8217;s the best way forward on universal health care.<br><br>And so we need &#8212; we need to become the party of ideas, the party that embraces the debate, the party that wants to build a big tent so that Progressives who want change, moderates who want solutions, independents who just want their elected officials to put the country first, and even those disaffected Republicans who look at this president and see that he has no moral compass and have turned their back on that party. If we become that party, we’re going to win every election. And more importantly, we&#8217;ll be able to govern.<br><br>Because whether it is creating universal health care, or dealing with climate change, or investing in communities that are left behind, or rebuilding our infrastructure, reforming our immigration system, creating universal pre-K, having more early childhood education, making community college free, launching national service, or dealing with all the blessings of technology and making sure the American people are equipped to deal with it. On all of these issues, there&#8217;s a common-sense way forward and let&#8217;s build that big coalition party and govern and lead this country.<br><br> God bless you.<br></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – June 7 is Gun Violence Awareness Day and John Delaney announces today his comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence in America. <br><br>“A majority of the American people want us to address gun violence and to take concrete actions to make our communities safer,” said John Delaney. “It is time to get this done, because no one should feel unsafe at school, at work, at the movies or anywhere else. We can’t let tragedy after tragedy happen and do nothing.” <br><br>Delaney’s plan includes:</p>



<ul><li>Universal Background Checks </li><li>An Assault Weapons Ban</li><li>Banning Bump Stocks</li><li>Closing the Boyfriend Loophole</li><li>Enacting a National Extreme Risk Protection Order Law</li><li>Ending the ban on Gun Violence Research<br></li></ul>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>John Delaney’s Gun Safety Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>The time has come for action on gun violence. According to the CDC, guns were responsible for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/11/18135976/gun-deaths-us-2017-suicide" target="_blank">nearly 40,000 deaths</a> in 2017, more than the number of deaths <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/11/18135976/gun-deaths-us-2017-suicide">caused by automobile accidents</a>. Large, bipartisan majorities support a broad range of common sense gun safety measures, but political partisanship has prevented the government from taking the necessary steps. Delaney believes it is possible to respect the Second Amendment and still adopt meaningful reforms.<br></p>



<p><strong>Universal Background Checks</strong><br>97 percent of the American people agree that we need universal background checks on gun sales, including closing the loophole for private sellers. Federal background checks stopped more than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694290.pdf" target="_blank">112,000 gun sales</a> out of approximately 8.6 million transactions in 2017, demonstrating that universal background checks <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694290.pdf">are an effective tool</a> to keep guns out of the wrong hands while still allowing law-abiding citizens their Second Amendment rights.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney supports requiring background checks for every gun sale.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Assault Weapons</strong><br>&nbsp;High-powered, military-style assault weapons have no place on our streets. Since the expiration of the original assault weapons ban in 2004, mass shootings have become far more deadly. Different variations of one type of assault weapon, the AR-15, have been used in some of America’s deadliest mass shootings, including Parkland, Sutherland Springs, Orlando, and Newtown.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney cosponsored the Assault Weapons Ban Act, which would ban semiautomatic weapons that have military-style features, including the AR-15.</li><li>This legislation also includes a ban on high-capacity magazines.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Bump Stocks</strong><br>These accessories, which allow individuals to modify standard semi-automatic rifles to mimic the rate of fire of a machine gun, were used in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Machine guns have been banned in the US for decades, and it is time that we prohibit accessories that can undermine this critical safety measure.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney will support legislation to codify a new regulation that bans all accessories designed to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon, including bump stocks and trigger cranks.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Extreme Risk Laws</strong><br>&nbsp;When a person knows that a family member poses an immediate threat to themselves or others, they should have a legal means to protect their safety by temporarily restricting access to guns. This has already been successfully implemented in Maryland with bipartisan support.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney is calling for a national extreme risk protection order law that would provide grants to support state, local, and tribal governments that adopt extreme risk laws, which allow family members and law enforcement officers to petition courts for temporary protective orders to restrict gun access for at-risk individuals.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Boyfriend Loophole</strong><br>&nbsp;Current federal law prevents certain convicted domestic abusers from buying guns, but the ban only applies to individuals convicted of abusing their spouse and does not cover instances of domestic violence in non-married couples. Intimate partner violence does not limit itself to married couples, and the gun safety measures in federal law shouldn’t be limited either.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney supports updating the Violence Against Women Act to extend the ban on convicted domestic abusers buying firearms to cover non-spouse partners.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Gun Violence Research</strong><br>Though the ban on CDC research into gun violence was finally lifted in 2018, Congress still has not provided funding. Providing full support for federal research would help prevent violence and save lives.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney will ensure that the government funds this vital field of research.</li></ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>“<em>Sen. Sanders’ Medicare For All Bill is bad policy and bad politics and will help get Donald Trump re-elected</em>”<br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD –</strong> In light of new debates about the best form of universal health care, John Delaney highlights his health care plan that provides universal coverage but gives Americans a mix of government and private options. This year, Delaney has announced comprehensive plans to establish <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">universal health care</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/mental-health/" target="_blank">expand mental health care coverage</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/prescription-drugs/" target="_blank">lower prescription drug prices. </a></p>



<p>Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“We can’t afford to play politics with our health care system.&nbsp;<strong>Sen. Sanders’ Medicare For All Bill is bad policy and bad politics and will help get Donald Trump re-elected.&nbsp;To beat Trump we must have an honest debate about the best way to ensure everyone has health care while also preserving options.&nbsp;</strong>Voters need to hear the truth, not more political slogans. My universal health care plan is the best path forward and would actually be the biggest and most progressive expansion of government health care coverage since the creation of Medicare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Americans want choices when it comes to health care, not a government-only-approach. My universal health care plan gives every American health care as a right, but still allows them to have private insurance if they so choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in the politics of addition, that we should be providing healthcare benefits to those who are uninsured or lack basic coverage, not telling 150 Million Americans that their health insurance is illegal, which the Medicare For All legislation explicitly does. That is the politics of subtraction.&nbsp; I don’t believe that the American people will support a system where they have to give up their health insurance, where low reimbursement rates will lead to hospital closures, or where a single President (like President Trump) is in charge of our entire health care system. These are my opinions and I believe the Democratic Party should be tolerant to everyone’s opinions if we want to chart the best path forward.”</p>



<p></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Health Care Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>I believe that health care is a fundamental right. I am proposing a universal health care plan that will provide high-quality care to everyone and replace our outdated system of employer-sponsored insurance. As President, I would roll this plan out to the American people after we fix the damage that the GOP has done to the Affordable Care Act and improve upon it. This way, Americans would once again get the benefits of the ACA while the nation and Congress have the time it takes to reform health care. Tying access to health insurance to employment forces workers to stay in jobs they don’t like, distracts entrepreneurs from their main focus of running their businesses, and prevents wages from increasing.<br></p>



<ul><li>Create a new public&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;plan for all Americans under the age of 65 while preserving traditional Medicare. My new plan would protect the reforms delivered by the Affordable&nbsp;Care&nbsp;Act, including guaranteed coverage of preexisting conditions and essential&nbsp;health benefits, and would make access truly universal. At 65, people would transition into Medicare. Medicaid would be absorbed by the new plan. The highly trusted Medicare provider network could be used for the new plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Guarantee universal coverage. Individuals would be automatically enrolled in the new public plan, with no complicated procedures to follow.</li><li>Keep&nbsp;private insurance options. Individuals and employers will be able to purchase and negotiate supplemental coverage from private insurers to cover additional&nbsp;health&nbsp;needs. These supplementals could merge into the basic plan to make it easier for the user.&nbsp;</li><li>Employers would be encouraged to negotiate group rate supplemental plans that would merge with the basic governmental plan so that employees would be able to keep their&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;plans, many of which are very popular and important to American families.</li></ul>



<p>In order to be sustainable, universal&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;needs to be paid for. My plan will lower the overall cost of&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;and put the government on a responsible fiscal path.</p>



<p>Pay-fors&nbsp;(numbers are based on a 10-year projection):</p>



<ul><li>The&nbsp;tax subsidy for employer-sponsored insurance costs the&nbsp;government&nbsp;more than $3.7 trillion and depresses wages for working Americans.</li><li>Allowing&nbsp;the government to negotiate drug prices would stop the transfer of wealth from working families to corporate executives and shareholders of pharmaceutical companies. This would save the government nearly $850 billion.</li><li>This&nbsp;plan would replace the ACA, and savings from ending the ACA’s tax subsidies would total $760 billion.</li><li>Current&nbsp;federal Medicaid spending is projected to be more than $4 trillion, which this plan would absorb.</li><li>States&nbsp;are projected to contribute more than $3.7 trillion to Medicaid. States would continue to pay their share for the current Medicaid population and the federal government would cover the cost of expanded coverage.</li><li>Implement&nbsp;a means-tested copay requirement for&nbsp;higher-income individuals to fund an increase in reimbursement rates for primary care&nbsp;providers.</li></ul>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney was applauded for his courage in an editorial published in today&#8217;s print edition of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Referring to Delaney’s criticism of the Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders, the editorial board wrote that Delaney deserved credit for telling his fellow Democrats “hard truths.”<br><br>This weekend at the California Democratic Party Convention, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=b75020e664&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">Delaney spoke out against single-payer Medicare for All.</a> Delaney has released a mixed-model <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=7d28c7b460&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">universal health care plan</a>.

Perhaps John Delaney and John Hickenlooper expected the jeering, given their remarks. Still, they deserve credit for telling their copartisans hard truths.<br><br>Mr. Delaney, a former Congressman from Maryland, is polling at 0.5% in the Real Clear Politics average. He told the convention that he supports universal health care, universal prekindergarten and free community college. But then he dismissed “slogans posing as policies.” A few minutes later: “Medicare for All may sound good. But it’s actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.”<br><br>Thus commenced two minutes of enthusiastic booing. As Mr. Delaney tried to explain over the din, millions of Americans have private insurance, which Medicare for All would abolish. “We should have universal health care,” he said. “But it shouldn’t be a kind of health care that kicks 150 million Americans off their health care. That’s not smart policy.”<br><br>Mr. Delaney expanded on this theme during an April visit to the Journal. He said Medicare for All is “based on a presumption that the government will pay enough for health care.” Yet both Medicaid and Medicare, he said, reimburse doctors at below cost: “We have ample evidence to suggest that if the government was the only payer in health care, it would never pay enough, and that would lead to a reduction in quality and access.” This is bitter medicine for San Francisco progressives, but it’s the unflinching reality.<br><br>The jeering was nearly as loud for John Hickenlooper, a former Governor of Colorado who’s also polling at 0.5%. He told the convention that President Trump is “threatening our democracy,” not to mention “dismantling our health care, destroying our planet, and creating a culture of hate.” <br><br>Then Mr. Hickenlooper added: “If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.” <em>Booo!</em><br><br>“We shouldn’t try to achieve universal coverage by removing private insurance from over 150 million Americans.” <em>Boooo!</em><br><br>“We should not try to tackle climate change by guaranteeing every American a government job.” <em>Booooo!</em><br>At one point, Mr. Hickenlooper broke from his speech to address the hecklers: “You know, if we’re not careful, we’re going to end up helping to re-elect the worst President in American history.”<br><br>The activists who attend these party conventions are well to the left of the average Democrat. Maybe that’s why Joe Biden, who leads the 2020 field, didn’t show up in San Francisco. At least Messrs. Delaney and Hickenlooper had the guts to face down the socialist crowd.<br><br> ###</p>

<h4><em>“We</em>’<em>ve got to be able to have a robust policy debate out in the open, that</em>’<em>s what this primary process should be about.”</em></h4>



<p></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, CA</strong>&nbsp;– Today, at the California Democratic Party Convention, John Delaney spoke on the need for Democrats to be a big tent party and called for a universal health care plan that doesn’t take the approach of Medicare for All, which would make private insurance illegal. (Delaney’s remarks as prepared for delivery are copied below.)<br><br><a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/">John Delaney’s universal health care plan</a>&nbsp;guarantees all Americans health care coverage as a right and also allows for people to have options and to purchase private insurance. Currently, over 150 million Americans have private insurance. The Sanders Medicare for All bill in the Senate would force them off of their private insurance and onto a government plan.<br><br><strong>Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“It was an honor to speak at the California Democratic Party Convention, truly. There was incredible energy all weekend and it was exciting to meet with so many high school kids who are working hard to make this country a better place. We’re strongest as a big tent party that can bring people together and I think most Democrats understand that, but some are more interested in purity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This isn’t a game &#8211; the policies we choose will impact hundreds of millions of people. We’ve got to be able to have a robust policy debate out in the open, that’s what this primary process should be about. A few boos aren’t a big deal, making a really bad mistake on health care is. We can’t be dedicated to slogans and must ensure that a real debate happens. Most of the Democrats in this field either don’t want to take this on or are trying to play it both ways, but I don’t think that’s responsible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a universal health care plan that guarantees everyone a basic government health care plan as a right, but also allows people to have options and doesn’t make private health insurance illegal. I think that’s better policy because study after study confirms that if all the health care bills in this country were paid at Medicare rates, then huge numbers of hospitals would close. I also think we should not be telling 150 million Americans that have private insurance (<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245195/americans-rate-healthcare-quite-positively.aspx">and 70% of them like it</a>) that their healthcare is illegal. It will be up to the American people to choose what they want, and I respect different views, but I’m not going to back down from my goal to create a universal healthcare system that works for every American.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Michael Starr Hopkins, Delaney’s National Press Secretary, releases the following statement:</strong></p>



<p>“The Democratic party is a big tent party with a range of viewpoints. What we saw in San Francisco while not surprising, was certainly disappointing. <br><br>“If Democrats think shouting down our own candidates is the path to beat Trump, it’s going to be a long primary season. We need a battle of ideas, not a circular firing squad. We as a party are better than what we witnessed today.”<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><br><strong>Delaney Remarks as Prepared for Delivery at California Democratic Party Convention</strong></p>



<p><br>Good morning, thank you for having me.<br><br>I come here today as someone who has lived the American dream and feels blessed by the opportunities this magnificent country has given me:<br><br>To learn, to get a great education despite the fact that my parents didn’t go to college<br><br>To earn, to become an entrepreneur build two deeply admired companies and create thousands of jobs<br><br>To serve in the Congress &#8212; working to see that everyone has the same opportunities to succeed that this working-class kid from New Jersey had. <br><br>And most importantly to be happily married to an amazing woman and raise four terrific daughters.<br><br>My story – the story of the American dream – is being pushed out of reach for young families and for the middle class. In fact, young people today will be the first generation of Americans to not do better than their parents. They are also left fiscal and climate debts they can’t repay. </p>



<p>How did this happen? Because we failed to do the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for a world that changed rapidly because of technological innovation and globalization.<br><br>A responsible government would have done things decades ago to fix healthcare, help workers by doubling the Earned Income Tax Credit, improve public education, address climate change and reform our broken immigration system. Each step of the way, efforts to do this were either blocked specifically by Republicans in Congress or by excessive partisanship generally.<br><br>I’m here today because I don’t believe that more hyper-partisan politics, ideological purity or slogans posing as policies, can do the things that America’s families need to have done. It takes real solutions.<br><br>“Moderate” “bipartisan” “problem solver” “Responsible” are the words that follow me around the campaign and I’m proud all of these labels. Because, more than anything, I believe in getting things done. If it takes policies more moderate than some of my colleague’s advocate, pushed through Congress with bipartisan support to get something done,&nbsp;<strong>then I am all in.&nbsp;</strong>Because I believe in the&nbsp;<strong>politics for progress.</strong><br><br>I think it was growing up the son of a union electrician that made me this way.<br><br>My dad ran wires through buildings, installed breaker boxes, hooked up HVAC systems to outside power sources.&nbsp; He wasn’t a glamorous guy. It wasn’t a glamorous job.&nbsp; He worked with his hands. There were no highbrow intellectual discussions at our table. His political lesson was simple:&nbsp; if you care about workers, you vote for the Democrats. Period. That, by the way is the Democratic party that wins every election.<br><br>But my dad did honest work.&nbsp;<br><br>And when you do honest day’s work, you get things done.&nbsp; You get a building that works.&nbsp; When you flip a switch, the lights come on. When you twist a faucet, water comes out.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Our current president doesn’t build, he brands.</strong>&nbsp;All he cares about is pasting his name in big gold letters on office towers, casinos, the wall. He doesn’t care if anything works. He puts his own self-interest ahead of everything.<br><br>That’s why his companies went bankrupt, while mine flourished. That’s why he stiffed working people like my dad, while my companies helped put thousands of people into good jobs and were admired in their communities. And its why his policies don’t work.<br><br>Ask the farmers who’ve seen prices go south ever since Donald Trump was sworn in if America’s working.&nbsp;<br><br>Ask the 40% of Americans who can’t afford basic needs, like housing, healthcare, food, and utilities if America works for them.<br><br>Ask the workers whose wages are not keeping up with inflation, while companies post record profits – if America is working for them.<br><br>But we can’t build an America that works for families from bumper sticker blueprints for castles in the sand.&nbsp; “Medicare for all” – which sounds good &#8211; will force hospitals across America to close their doors because Medicare payments alone won’t cover hospitals’ expenses and will cause 150 million Americans to lose their health insurance, which 70% of them like. Is that good policy? Or more importantly, Is that a formula for winning elections?&nbsp; My plan will ensure basic coverage for every American as a right but allow supplemental coverage and other options to provide choices while also that generates revenues that will keep hospitals open and fund research and innovation.<br><br>You see, I don’t want to be the most ideologically pure president. I want to be the president that makes things work. That gets things done.&nbsp; That is the responsible leader your kids deserve.</p>



<p>We didn’t flip the House with candidates that ran on rigid platforms. They won because they built coalitions, pursued center-left policies and campaigned everywhere. And promised to pursue common-sense plans that work.<br><br>We can do that in 2020. We can run, win, and govern on a government that works again for working families, for union members, for small farmers, and for young people.<br><br>That’s my kind of radical.<br><br>That’s why my campaign says: If you’re a progressive Democrat who wants real change, come on board.  If you’re a centrist Democrat who wants to get things done, come on board.  If you’re an independent who wants politicians to put their country ahead of their party, come on board. <br><br>And, if you’re a Republican disgusted by a president with no moral compass and a party that’s become a force for bigotry and privilege and corruption. and you want to restore a sense of decency and respect to the office of the presidency, come on board.  That is the coalition we need to win in 2020 and to govern going forward.  Because this election will be fought right down the center.<br><br>But we have to stop talking and start doing.  We have to be honest about the problems and honest about the solutions. And we have to bring people together to find, as JFK put it, “not the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.”<br><br>If we can do that, if we can work together towards honest solutions that create opportunity and restore the middle class, we make the magnificent machinery of our democracy sing once again.<br><br></p>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs.html" target="_blank">President Trump announced a potential 5 percent tariff</a> on all imported goods from Mexico. The tariff would gradually increase until all undocumented immigration stops. As one of the few 2020 candidates to support President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, John Delaney has made trade policy a priority on the campaign trail as tariffs have devastated the midwest. <br><br><strong>Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“Just when we thought Trump couldn’t make his trade war policies and his immigration policies worse, Trump decides to lump them together into one.  <em>We all know that Trump doesn’t understand how any of these policies actually affect working Americans.</em>  It’s time for Congress to stop Trump’s trade wars and to come together in a bipartisan manner to pass comprehensive immigration reform and pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>“As your President, I won’t walk out of an infrastructure meeting with Congressional leaders and act like a spoiled child; I will roll up my sleeves and do what my dad the electrician did his whole life, get to work and start building things &#8211; big things &#8211; again.”</em><br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Today, John Delaney releases his $2 trillion Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive set of policies to address the nation’s infrastructure crisis. Delaney’s plan includes rebuilding our roads and bridges, rebuilding water systems, boosting climate resiliency, and investing in communities left behind. The plan is fully paid for. According to the Washington Post, “[t]he shoddy state of the nation’s roads cost the average driver $515 in extra operation and maintenance costs. [T]wenty-eight percent of the nation’s major roadways &#8212; interstates, freeways and major arterial roadways in urban areas – are in ‘poor’ condition.”<br><br>Delaney’s plan increases the size of the Highway Trust Fund and creates seven new infrastructure funds:</p>



<ol><li>A National Infrastructure Bank</li><li>A Climate Resiliency Fund</li><li>A Water Infrastructure Matching Fund</li><li>A School Infrastructure Matching Fund</li><li>Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund&nbsp;</li><li>Rural Broadband Matching Fund</li><li>An Areas Left Behind Matching Fund</li></ol>



<p>“There are no easy answers to many of our economic issues but there are simple answers, including launching a massive, job-creating, community improving infrastructure program to rebuild our roads and bridges, extend rural broadband, improve decaying water systems, and build the advanced energy economy,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong>  “As the author of the largest bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Congress, I know how to get this done.  <br><br>“My $2 trillion infrastructure program is fully paid for and will transform our entire country and allow us to dream big again as a nation.  As your President, I won’t walk out of an infrastructure meeting with Congressional leaders and act like a spoiled child; I will roll up my sleeves and do what my dad the electrician did his whole life, get to work and start building things &#8211; big things &#8211; again.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><br><strong>Delaney’s Infrastructure Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Investment in infrastructure is long overdue as spending on infrastructure in relation to GDP has steadily dropped over the past several decades, with most funding coming from state and local governments. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the U.S. a D+ average on our infrastructure. Not only is infrastructure funding necessary to improve the system, investing in rebuilding crumbling infrastructure is a job creator and will boost the economy. Infrastructure has the second highest return on investment for the government.<br><br>Delaney will pay for his plan by raising the corporate tax rate to 27% and increasing the federal gas tax to account for inflation since the last increase and indexing it for inflation going forward. Projects supported through Delaney’s infrastructure plan will be governed by federal labor protections including paying workers prevailing wages.<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Bank</strong><br>Delaney has been an ardent supporter of the need to create an Infrastructure Bank. While in Congress, he introduced bipartisan legislation that would create an Infrastructure Bank to make it easier and cheaper for states and local governments to invest in local infrastructure in the categories of transportation, water, energy, communications, and school facilities. As part of his infrastructure plan, Delaney proposes capitalizing an Infrastructure Bank with $50 billion which can leverage $750 billion of infrastructure projects around the country while encouraging public-private partnerships.<br></li><li><strong>Highway Trust Fund</strong><br>American roads and mass transit have been systematically underfunded which has led to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) giving our roads a D on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/" target="_blank">annual report card</a> with mass transit receiving a D-. Not only does the Highway Trust Fund, the main source of federal funding for roads and mass transit, struggle to remain solvent but the current level of funding still leaves massive shortfalls in meeting total needs for surface transportation. To address these deficiencies, Delaney proposes increasing the HTF with a one-time boost of $200 billion, bringing the Fund to almost $850 billion over the next 10 years. It is paid for by retroactively indexing the gas tax to inflation and by raising the corporate tax rate to 27%. <strong>Delaney’s plan will increase direct investment by the Highway Trust Fund by 50% over the next decade.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Climate Infrastructure Fund</strong><br>Climate change has led to more frequent and dangerous storms, which have resulted in widespread damage across the country. These storms have had devastating effects including increased forest fires and flooding. What meteorologists deem as 100- year floods have been occurring with more frequency, leading to widespread destruction to land, people’s homes, and public infrastructure. Recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2019/05/15/iowa-flooding-levee-repairs-leave-riverside-communities-stressed/3678703002/" target="_blank">in Iowa when the levees broke</a> along the Missouri River, communities were flooded resulting in billions of dollars in damage and forcing people from their homes.  We also need to make our energy transmission systems more efficient to better conserve energy and avoid waste.<br><br>We need to invest in and improve climate resilient infrastructure to protect communities against the effects of climate change, which is why Delaney proposes the creation of a $60 billion Climate Infrastructure Fund that will allow state and local governments to invest in and prioritize projects that will expand and improve climate resilient infrastructure in addition to improving energy efficiency in our systems. This will also pay for Delaney’s previously announced Carbon Throughway, an infrastructure project that will transport captured carbon from the Midwest for permanent sequestration and reuse in the Permian Basin.<br><br>In addition to the Infrastructure Bank, increasing the Highway Trust Fund, and increasing funding for climate infrastructure, Delaney proposes creating five funds that match state and local investments 4:1 in specific categories.<br></li><li><strong>Water Infrastructure Matching Fund</strong><br>While cracked roads and bridges are readily apparent to anyone who looks around, equally important infrastructure exists below ground that we can’t see.  Around the country, too many cities are suffering from poor water quality and crumbling water systems. The crisis in Flint, Michigan is just one tragic example of the serious health effects of not ensuring that every American has access to clean water. Aging water systems have led to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Drinking-Water-Final.pdf" target="_blank">nearly six billion gallons</a> of treated drinking water lost daily due to leaking pipes. ASCE rated American water infrastructure a D while wastewater received a D+.  In addition, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/ports/" target="_blank">American ports and harbors have been underinvested in</a>, even while they facilitate almost 99% of overseas trade and are responsible for $4.6 trillion in economic activity. To facilitate changes in shipping and the size of the ships, ports need continued investment to modernize and maintain operability.  <br><br>To address the insufficient focus on water infrastructure, Delaney proposes supplementing WIFIA and the existing state revolving funds with the creation of a new $40 billion Water Infrastructure Matching Fund to allow state and local governments to have dedicated funding to invest in ports and harbors and fix aging water systems to ensure a Flint water crisis never happens again.<br></li><li><strong>School Infrastructure Matching Fund</strong><br>In too many districts, America’s public schools are overcrowded and outdated. Public school buildings on average are more than 40 years old, and s<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/ports/" target="_blank">tructural deficiencies in school buildings are associated with poor health and decreased academic performance</a>.  No child should have to attend school without adequate air conditioning, with crumbling ceilings, or with drinking fountains with water too contaminated to drink. Delaney’s $40 billion School Infrastructure Matching Fund will allow state and local governments to build new schools to keep pace with growing populations and to make necessary improvements to existing facilities.<br></li><li><strong>Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund</strong><br>Years of partisanship and government gridlock have meant that we only address major infrastructure problems through expensive new projects or in response to a crisis or an emergency. We need to confront the deferred maintenance needs of existing infrastructure to keep systems in good repair and prevent disasters. Demand is growing for freight and passenger rail capacity, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rail-Final.pdf" target="_blank">our current system is ridden with maintenance backlogs on projects</a> with an average age of 111 years. In addition, there are more than 47,000 structurally deficient bridges in the US, and at the current rate of maintenance work it would take <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artbabridgereport.org/" target="_blank">more than 80 years</a> to make the needed repairs. Delaney will address this problem by creating a $40 billion Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund to assist states and municipalities in taking care of the infrastructure we already have.<br></li><li><strong>Areas Left Behind Matching Fund</strong><br>State governments have limited capacity for new infrastructure projects and face significant financial constraints, which means that projects in prosperous areas often receive priority while disadvantaged communities can have their needs neglected. Lack of investment is a problem for both urban and rural communities. Struggling urban neighborhoods need robust transit networks, like the canceled Red Line light rail project that would have served inner-city Baltimore, and rural communities have transportation infrastructure needs, including bridges and tunnels, that are passed over in favor of larger projects in more populous areas. We need to consider the cost of not investing in struggling communities and to address the persistent funding gap. To encourage states to invest in the infrastructure needs of economically-distressed communities, Delaney will create a $40 billion matching fund dedicated to projects in areas that have been left behind.<br></li><li><strong>Rural Broadband Matching Fund </strong><br>Access to high-speed, reliable broadband is a necessity in the 21st century. Communities rely on it for employment and academic opportunities and to connect people to telemedicine providers. However, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2016-broadband-progress-report" target="_blank">almost 40% of those in rural areas lack access to reliable broadband</a>, putting them at a disadvantage to the rest of the country. To close the gap and ensure rural America has access to the necessary technology, Delaney will create a $40 billion Rural Broadband Matching Fund dedicated to building broadband infrastructure.<br></li></ol>
