								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>“<em>Sen. Sanders’ Medicare For All Bill is bad policy and bad politics and will help get Donald Trump re-elected</em>”<br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD –</strong> In light of new debates about the best form of universal health care, John Delaney highlights his health care plan that provides universal coverage but gives Americans a mix of government and private options. This year, Delaney has announced comprehensive plans to establish <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">universal health care</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/mental-health/" target="_blank">expand mental health care coverage</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/prescription-drugs/" target="_blank">lower prescription drug prices. </a></p>



<p>Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“We can’t afford to play politics with our health care system.&nbsp;<strong>Sen. Sanders’ Medicare For All Bill is bad policy and bad politics and will help get Donald Trump re-elected.&nbsp;To beat Trump we must have an honest debate about the best way to ensure everyone has health care while also preserving options.&nbsp;</strong>Voters need to hear the truth, not more political slogans. My universal health care plan is the best path forward and would actually be the biggest and most progressive expansion of government health care coverage since the creation of Medicare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Americans want choices when it comes to health care, not a government-only-approach. My universal health care plan gives every American health care as a right, but still allows them to have private insurance if they so choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in the politics of addition, that we should be providing healthcare benefits to those who are uninsured or lack basic coverage, not telling 150 Million Americans that their health insurance is illegal, which the Medicare For All legislation explicitly does. That is the politics of subtraction.&nbsp; I don’t believe that the American people will support a system where they have to give up their health insurance, where low reimbursement rates will lead to hospital closures, or where a single President (like President Trump) is in charge of our entire health care system. These are my opinions and I believe the Democratic Party should be tolerant to everyone’s opinions if we want to chart the best path forward.”</p>



<p></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Health Care Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>I believe that health care is a fundamental right. I am proposing a universal health care plan that will provide high-quality care to everyone and replace our outdated system of employer-sponsored insurance. As President, I would roll this plan out to the American people after we fix the damage that the GOP has done to the Affordable Care Act and improve upon it. This way, Americans would once again get the benefits of the ACA while the nation and Congress have the time it takes to reform health care. Tying access to health insurance to employment forces workers to stay in jobs they don’t like, distracts entrepreneurs from their main focus of running their businesses, and prevents wages from increasing.<br></p>



<ul><li>Create a new public&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;plan for all Americans under the age of 65 while preserving traditional Medicare. My new plan would protect the reforms delivered by the Affordable&nbsp;Care&nbsp;Act, including guaranteed coverage of preexisting conditions and essential&nbsp;health benefits, and would make access truly universal. At 65, people would transition into Medicare. Medicaid would be absorbed by the new plan. The highly trusted Medicare provider network could be used for the new plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Guarantee universal coverage. Individuals would be automatically enrolled in the new public plan, with no complicated procedures to follow.</li><li>Keep&nbsp;private insurance options. Individuals and employers will be able to purchase and negotiate supplemental coverage from private insurers to cover additional&nbsp;health&nbsp;needs. These supplementals could merge into the basic plan to make it easier for the user.&nbsp;</li><li>Employers would be encouraged to negotiate group rate supplemental plans that would merge with the basic governmental plan so that employees would be able to keep their&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;plans, many of which are very popular and important to American families.</li></ul>



<p>In order to be sustainable, universal&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;needs to be paid for. My plan will lower the overall cost of&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;and put the government on a responsible fiscal path.</p>



<p>Pay-fors&nbsp;(numbers are based on a 10-year projection):</p>



<ul><li>The&nbsp;tax subsidy for employer-sponsored insurance costs the&nbsp;government&nbsp;more than $3.7 trillion and depresses wages for working Americans.</li><li>Allowing&nbsp;the government to negotiate drug prices would stop the transfer of wealth from working families to corporate executives and shareholders of pharmaceutical companies. This would save the government nearly $850 billion.</li><li>This&nbsp;plan would replace the ACA, and savings from ending the ACA’s tax subsidies would total $760 billion.</li><li>Current&nbsp;federal Medicaid spending is projected to be more than $4 trillion, which this plan would absorb.</li><li>States&nbsp;are projected to contribute more than $3.7 trillion to Medicaid. States would continue to pay their share for the current Medicaid population and the federal government would cover the cost of expanded coverage.</li><li>Implement&nbsp;a means-tested copay requirement for&nbsp;higher-income individuals to fund an increase in reimbursement rates for primary care&nbsp;providers.</li></ul>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney was applauded for his courage in an editorial published in today&#8217;s print edition of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Referring to Delaney’s criticism of the Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders, the editorial board wrote that Delaney deserved credit for telling his fellow Democrats “hard truths.”<br><br>This weekend at the California Democratic Party Convention, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=b75020e664&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">Delaney spoke out against single-payer Medicare for All.</a> Delaney has released a mixed-model <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=7d28c7b460&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">universal health care plan</a>.

Perhaps John Delaney and John Hickenlooper expected the jeering, given their remarks. Still, they deserve credit for telling their copartisans hard truths.<br><br>Mr. Delaney, a former Congressman from Maryland, is polling at 0.5% in the Real Clear Politics average. He told the convention that he supports universal health care, universal prekindergarten and free community college. But then he dismissed “slogans posing as policies.” A few minutes later: “Medicare for All may sound good. But it’s actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.”<br><br>Thus commenced two minutes of enthusiastic booing. As Mr. Delaney tried to explain over the din, millions of Americans have private insurance, which Medicare for All would abolish. “We should have universal health care,” he said. “But it shouldn’t be a kind of health care that kicks 150 million Americans off their health care. That’s not smart policy.”<br><br>Mr. Delaney expanded on this theme during an April visit to the Journal. He said Medicare for All is “based on a presumption that the government will pay enough for health care.” Yet both Medicaid and Medicare, he said, reimburse doctors at below cost: “We have ample evidence to suggest that if the government was the only payer in health care, it would never pay enough, and that would lead to a reduction in quality and access.” This is bitter medicine for San Francisco progressives, but it’s the unflinching reality.<br><br>The jeering was nearly as loud for John Hickenlooper, a former Governor of Colorado who’s also polling at 0.5%. He told the convention that President Trump is “threatening our democracy,” not to mention “dismantling our health care, destroying our planet, and creating a culture of hate.” <br><br>Then Mr. Hickenlooper added: “If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.” <em>Booo!</em><br><br>“We shouldn’t try to achieve universal coverage by removing private insurance from over 150 million Americans.” <em>Boooo!</em><br><br>“We should not try to tackle climate change by guaranteeing every American a government job.” <em>Booooo!</em><br>At one point, Mr. Hickenlooper broke from his speech to address the hecklers: “You know, if we’re not careful, we’re going to end up helping to re-elect the worst President in American history.”<br><br>The activists who attend these party conventions are well to the left of the average Democrat. Maybe that’s why Joe Biden, who leads the 2020 field, didn’t show up in San Francisco. At least Messrs. Delaney and Hickenlooper had the guts to face down the socialist crowd.<br><br> ###</p>

<h4><em>“We</em>’<em>ve got to be able to have a robust policy debate out in the open, that</em>’<em>s what this primary process should be about.”</em></h4>



<p></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, CA</strong>&nbsp;– Today, at the California Democratic Party Convention, John Delaney spoke on the need for Democrats to be a big tent party and called for a universal health care plan that doesn’t take the approach of Medicare for All, which would make private insurance illegal. (Delaney’s remarks as prepared for delivery are copied below.)<br><br><a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/">John Delaney’s universal health care plan</a>&nbsp;guarantees all Americans health care coverage as a right and also allows for people to have options and to purchase private insurance. Currently, over 150 million Americans have private insurance. The Sanders Medicare for All bill in the Senate would force them off of their private insurance and onto a government plan.<br><br><strong>Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“It was an honor to speak at the California Democratic Party Convention, truly. There was incredible energy all weekend and it was exciting to meet with so many high school kids who are working hard to make this country a better place. We’re strongest as a big tent party that can bring people together and I think most Democrats understand that, but some are more interested in purity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This isn’t a game &#8211; the policies we choose will impact hundreds of millions of people. We’ve got to be able to have a robust policy debate out in the open, that’s what this primary process should be about. A few boos aren’t a big deal, making a really bad mistake on health care is. We can’t be dedicated to slogans and must ensure that a real debate happens. Most of the Democrats in this field either don’t want to take this on or are trying to play it both ways, but I don’t think that’s responsible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a universal health care plan that guarantees everyone a basic government health care plan as a right, but also allows people to have options and doesn’t make private health insurance illegal. I think that’s better policy because study after study confirms that if all the health care bills in this country were paid at Medicare rates, then huge numbers of hospitals would close. I also think we should not be telling 150 million Americans that have private insurance (<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245195/americans-rate-healthcare-quite-positively.aspx">and 70% of them like it</a>) that their healthcare is illegal. It will be up to the American people to choose what they want, and I respect different views, but I’m not going to back down from my goal to create a universal healthcare system that works for every American.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Michael Starr Hopkins, Delaney’s National Press Secretary, releases the following statement:</strong></p>



<p>“The Democratic party is a big tent party with a range of viewpoints. What we saw in San Francisco while not surprising, was certainly disappointing. <br><br>“If Democrats think shouting down our own candidates is the path to beat Trump, it’s going to be a long primary season. We need a battle of ideas, not a circular firing squad. We as a party are better than what we witnessed today.”<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><br><strong>Delaney Remarks as Prepared for Delivery at California Democratic Party Convention</strong></p>



<p><br>Good morning, thank you for having me.<br><br>I come here today as someone who has lived the American dream and feels blessed by the opportunities this magnificent country has given me:<br><br>To learn, to get a great education despite the fact that my parents didn’t go to college<br><br>To earn, to become an entrepreneur build two deeply admired companies and create thousands of jobs<br><br>To serve in the Congress &#8212; working to see that everyone has the same opportunities to succeed that this working-class kid from New Jersey had. <br><br>And most importantly to be happily married to an amazing woman and raise four terrific daughters.<br><br>My story – the story of the American dream – is being pushed out of reach for young families and for the middle class. In fact, young people today will be the first generation of Americans to not do better than their parents. They are also left fiscal and climate debts they can’t repay. </p>



<p>How did this happen? Because we failed to do the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for a world that changed rapidly because of technological innovation and globalization.<br><br>A responsible government would have done things decades ago to fix healthcare, help workers by doubling the Earned Income Tax Credit, improve public education, address climate change and reform our broken immigration system. Each step of the way, efforts to do this were either blocked specifically by Republicans in Congress or by excessive partisanship generally.<br><br>I’m here today because I don’t believe that more hyper-partisan politics, ideological purity or slogans posing as policies, can do the things that America’s families need to have done. It takes real solutions.<br><br>“Moderate” “bipartisan” “problem solver” “Responsible” are the words that follow me around the campaign and I’m proud all of these labels. Because, more than anything, I believe in getting things done. If it takes policies more moderate than some of my colleague’s advocate, pushed through Congress with bipartisan support to get something done,&nbsp;<strong>then I am all in.&nbsp;</strong>Because I believe in the&nbsp;<strong>politics for progress.</strong><br><br>I think it was growing up the son of a union electrician that made me this way.<br><br>My dad ran wires through buildings, installed breaker boxes, hooked up HVAC systems to outside power sources.&nbsp; He wasn’t a glamorous guy. It wasn’t a glamorous job.&nbsp; He worked with his hands. There were no highbrow intellectual discussions at our table. His political lesson was simple:&nbsp; if you care about workers, you vote for the Democrats. Period. That, by the way is the Democratic party that wins every election.<br><br>But my dad did honest work.&nbsp;<br><br>And when you do honest day’s work, you get things done.&nbsp; You get a building that works.&nbsp; When you flip a switch, the lights come on. When you twist a faucet, water comes out.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Our current president doesn’t build, he brands.</strong>&nbsp;All he cares about is pasting his name in big gold letters on office towers, casinos, the wall. He doesn’t care if anything works. He puts his own self-interest ahead of everything.<br><br>That’s why his companies went bankrupt, while mine flourished. That’s why he stiffed working people like my dad, while my companies helped put thousands of people into good jobs and were admired in their communities. And its why his policies don’t work.<br><br>Ask the farmers who’ve seen prices go south ever since Donald Trump was sworn in if America’s working.&nbsp;<br><br>Ask the 40% of Americans who can’t afford basic needs, like housing, healthcare, food, and utilities if America works for them.<br><br>Ask the workers whose wages are not keeping up with inflation, while companies post record profits – if America is working for them.<br><br>But we can’t build an America that works for families from bumper sticker blueprints for castles in the sand.&nbsp; “Medicare for all” – which sounds good &#8211; will force hospitals across America to close their doors because Medicare payments alone won’t cover hospitals’ expenses and will cause 150 million Americans to lose their health insurance, which 70% of them like. Is that good policy? Or more importantly, Is that a formula for winning elections?&nbsp; My plan will ensure basic coverage for every American as a right but allow supplemental coverage and other options to provide choices while also that generates revenues that will keep hospitals open and fund research and innovation.<br><br>You see, I don’t want to be the most ideologically pure president. I want to be the president that makes things work. That gets things done.&nbsp; That is the responsible leader your kids deserve.</p>



<p>We didn’t flip the House with candidates that ran on rigid platforms. They won because they built coalitions, pursued center-left policies and campaigned everywhere. And promised to pursue common-sense plans that work.<br><br>We can do that in 2020. We can run, win, and govern on a government that works again for working families, for union members, for small farmers, and for young people.<br><br>That’s my kind of radical.<br><br>That’s why my campaign says: If you’re a progressive Democrat who wants real change, come on board.  If you’re a centrist Democrat who wants to get things done, come on board.  If you’re an independent who wants politicians to put their country ahead of their party, come on board. <br><br>And, if you’re a Republican disgusted by a president with no moral compass and a party that’s become a force for bigotry and privilege and corruption. and you want to restore a sense of decency and respect to the office of the presidency, come on board.  That is the coalition we need to win in 2020 and to govern going forward.  Because this election will be fought right down the center.<br><br>But we have to stop talking and start doing.  We have to be honest about the problems and honest about the solutions. And we have to bring people together to find, as JFK put it, “not the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.”<br><br>If we can do that, if we can work together towards honest solutions that create opportunity and restore the middle class, we make the magnificent machinery of our democracy sing once again.<br><br></p>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs.html" target="_blank">President Trump announced a potential 5 percent tariff</a> on all imported goods from Mexico. The tariff would gradually increase until all undocumented immigration stops. As one of the few 2020 candidates to support President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, John Delaney has made trade policy a priority on the campaign trail as tariffs have devastated the midwest. <br><br><strong>Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“Just when we thought Trump couldn’t make his trade war policies and his immigration policies worse, Trump decides to lump them together into one.  <em>We all know that Trump doesn’t understand how any of these policies actually affect working Americans.</em>  It’s time for Congress to stop Trump’s trade wars and to come together in a bipartisan manner to pass comprehensive immigration reform and pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em>“As your President, I won’t walk out of an infrastructure meeting with Congressional leaders and act like a spoiled child; I will roll up my sleeves and do what my dad the electrician did his whole life, get to work and start building things &#8211; big things &#8211; again.”</em><br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Today, John Delaney releases his $2 trillion Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive set of policies to address the nation’s infrastructure crisis. Delaney’s plan includes rebuilding our roads and bridges, rebuilding water systems, boosting climate resiliency, and investing in communities left behind. The plan is fully paid for. According to the Washington Post, “[t]he shoddy state of the nation’s roads cost the average driver $515 in extra operation and maintenance costs. [T]wenty-eight percent of the nation’s major roadways &#8212; interstates, freeways and major arterial roadways in urban areas – are in ‘poor’ condition.”<br><br>Delaney’s plan increases the size of the Highway Trust Fund and creates seven new infrastructure funds:</p>



<ol><li>A National Infrastructure Bank</li><li>A Climate Resiliency Fund</li><li>A Water Infrastructure Matching Fund</li><li>A School Infrastructure Matching Fund</li><li>Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund&nbsp;</li><li>Rural Broadband Matching Fund</li><li>An Areas Left Behind Matching Fund</li></ol>



<p>“There are no easy answers to many of our economic issues but there are simple answers, including launching a massive, job-creating, community improving infrastructure program to rebuild our roads and bridges, extend rural broadband, improve decaying water systems, and build the advanced energy economy,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong>  “As the author of the largest bipartisan infrastructure bill in the Congress, I know how to get this done.  <br><br>“My $2 trillion infrastructure program is fully paid for and will transform our entire country and allow us to dream big again as a nation.  As your President, I won’t walk out of an infrastructure meeting with Congressional leaders and act like a spoiled child; I will roll up my sleeves and do what my dad the electrician did his whole life, get to work and start building things &#8211; big things &#8211; again.”</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><br><strong>Delaney’s Infrastructure Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>Investment in infrastructure is long overdue as spending on infrastructure in relation to GDP has steadily dropped over the past several decades, with most funding coming from state and local governments. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave the U.S. a D+ average on our infrastructure. Not only is infrastructure funding necessary to improve the system, investing in rebuilding crumbling infrastructure is a job creator and will boost the economy. Infrastructure has the second highest return on investment for the government.<br><br>Delaney will pay for his plan by raising the corporate tax rate to 27% and increasing the federal gas tax to account for inflation since the last increase and indexing it for inflation going forward. Projects supported through Delaney’s infrastructure plan will be governed by federal labor protections including paying workers prevailing wages.<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Infrastructure Bank</strong><br>Delaney has been an ardent supporter of the need to create an Infrastructure Bank. While in Congress, he introduced bipartisan legislation that would create an Infrastructure Bank to make it easier and cheaper for states and local governments to invest in local infrastructure in the categories of transportation, water, energy, communications, and school facilities. As part of his infrastructure plan, Delaney proposes capitalizing an Infrastructure Bank with $50 billion which can leverage $750 billion of infrastructure projects around the country while encouraging public-private partnerships.<br></li><li><strong>Highway Trust Fund</strong><br>American roads and mass transit have been systematically underfunded which has led to the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) giving our roads a D on their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/" target="_blank">annual report card</a> with mass transit receiving a D-. Not only does the Highway Trust Fund, the main source of federal funding for roads and mass transit, struggle to remain solvent but the current level of funding still leaves massive shortfalls in meeting total needs for surface transportation. To address these deficiencies, Delaney proposes increasing the HTF with a one-time boost of $200 billion, bringing the Fund to almost $850 billion over the next 10 years. It is paid for by retroactively indexing the gas tax to inflation and by raising the corporate tax rate to 27%. <strong>Delaney’s plan will increase direct investment by the Highway Trust Fund by 50% over the next decade.</strong><br></li><li><strong>Climate Infrastructure Fund</strong><br>Climate change has led to more frequent and dangerous storms, which have resulted in widespread damage across the country. These storms have had devastating effects including increased forest fires and flooding. What meteorologists deem as 100- year floods have been occurring with more frequency, leading to widespread destruction to land, people’s homes, and public infrastructure. Recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/2019/05/15/iowa-flooding-levee-repairs-leave-riverside-communities-stressed/3678703002/" target="_blank">in Iowa when the levees broke</a> along the Missouri River, communities were flooded resulting in billions of dollars in damage and forcing people from their homes.  We also need to make our energy transmission systems more efficient to better conserve energy and avoid waste.<br><br>We need to invest in and improve climate resilient infrastructure to protect communities against the effects of climate change, which is why Delaney proposes the creation of a $60 billion Climate Infrastructure Fund that will allow state and local governments to invest in and prioritize projects that will expand and improve climate resilient infrastructure in addition to improving energy efficiency in our systems. This will also pay for Delaney’s previously announced Carbon Throughway, an infrastructure project that will transport captured carbon from the Midwest for permanent sequestration and reuse in the Permian Basin.<br><br>In addition to the Infrastructure Bank, increasing the Highway Trust Fund, and increasing funding for climate infrastructure, Delaney proposes creating five funds that match state and local investments 4:1 in specific categories.<br></li><li><strong>Water Infrastructure Matching Fund</strong><br>While cracked roads and bridges are readily apparent to anyone who looks around, equally important infrastructure exists below ground that we can’t see.  Around the country, too many cities are suffering from poor water quality and crumbling water systems. The crisis in Flint, Michigan is just one tragic example of the serious health effects of not ensuring that every American has access to clean water. Aging water systems have led to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Drinking-Water-Final.pdf" target="_blank">nearly six billion gallons</a> of treated drinking water lost daily due to leaking pipes. ASCE rated American water infrastructure a D while wastewater received a D+.  In addition, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/ports/" target="_blank">American ports and harbors have been underinvested in</a>, even while they facilitate almost 99% of overseas trade and are responsible for $4.6 trillion in economic activity. To facilitate changes in shipping and the size of the ships, ports need continued investment to modernize and maintain operability.  <br><br>To address the insufficient focus on water infrastructure, Delaney proposes supplementing WIFIA and the existing state revolving funds with the creation of a new $40 billion Water Infrastructure Matching Fund to allow state and local governments to have dedicated funding to invest in ports and harbors and fix aging water systems to ensure a Flint water crisis never happens again.<br></li><li><strong>School Infrastructure Matching Fund</strong><br>In too many districts, America’s public schools are overcrowded and outdated. Public school buildings on average are more than 40 years old, and s<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/ports/" target="_blank">tructural deficiencies in school buildings are associated with poor health and decreased academic performance</a>.  No child should have to attend school without adequate air conditioning, with crumbling ceilings, or with drinking fountains with water too contaminated to drink. Delaney’s $40 billion School Infrastructure Matching Fund will allow state and local governments to build new schools to keep pace with growing populations and to make necessary improvements to existing facilities.<br></li><li><strong>Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund</strong><br>Years of partisanship and government gridlock have meant that we only address major infrastructure problems through expensive new projects or in response to a crisis or an emergency. We need to confront the deferred maintenance needs of existing infrastructure to keep systems in good repair and prevent disasters. Demand is growing for freight and passenger rail capacity, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.infrastructurereportcard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Rail-Final.pdf" target="_blank">our current system is ridden with maintenance backlogs on projects</a> with an average age of 111 years. In addition, there are more than 47,000 structurally deficient bridges in the US, and at the current rate of maintenance work it would take <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://artbabridgereport.org/" target="_blank">more than 80 years</a> to make the needed repairs. Delaney will address this problem by creating a $40 billion Deferred Maintenance Matching Fund to assist states and municipalities in taking care of the infrastructure we already have.<br></li><li><strong>Areas Left Behind Matching Fund</strong><br>State governments have limited capacity for new infrastructure projects and face significant financial constraints, which means that projects in prosperous areas often receive priority while disadvantaged communities can have their needs neglected. Lack of investment is a problem for both urban and rural communities. Struggling urban neighborhoods need robust transit networks, like the canceled Red Line light rail project that would have served inner-city Baltimore, and rural communities have transportation infrastructure needs, including bridges and tunnels, that are passed over in favor of larger projects in more populous areas. We need to consider the cost of not investing in struggling communities and to address the persistent funding gap. To encourage states to invest in the infrastructure needs of economically-distressed communities, Delaney will create a $40 billion matching fund dedicated to projects in areas that have been left behind.<br></li><li><strong>Rural Broadband Matching Fund </strong><br>Access to high-speed, reliable broadband is a necessity in the 21st century. Communities rely on it for employment and academic opportunities and to connect people to telemedicine providers. However, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2016-broadband-progress-report" target="_blank">almost 40% of those in rural areas lack access to reliable broadband</a>, putting them at a disadvantage to the rest of the country. To close the gap and ensure rural America has access to the necessary technology, Delaney will create a $40 billion Rural Broadband Matching Fund dedicated to building broadband infrastructure.<br></li></ol>

<p><strong>Delaney Campaign Highlights&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Policy&nbsp;Focus</strong></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD –&nbsp;</strong>According to multiple analysts and pundits,&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;has not played a large role in the Democratic primary to date.<br><br><strong>John Delaney’s National Press Secretary, Michael Starr Hopkins, releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“There has been commentary in the media in recent days concerning lack of attention to&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues among Democratic presidential candidates.</p>



<p>“That is not the case with the Delaney for President 2020 Campaign.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“John Delaney considers&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;as the unique area in which the President of the United States has grave responsibility and clear authority to defend the interests of the United States and to represent the United States in the global community.&nbsp; He places high priority on covering all&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy issues and stands prepared to assume the responsibility of managing our country’s&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;affairs and national defense from the first hour of his presidency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Delaney Campaign appointed a&nbsp;Foreign&nbsp;Policy&nbsp;Coordinator in November 2018 and has developed a network&nbsp;from prestigious think tanks&nbsp;and universities&nbsp;of&nbsp;about 250 experts on more than thirty&nbsp;foreign&nbsp;policy&nbsp;issues from whom we draw for private one-on-one meetings and roundtable discussions. We have prioritized regular foreign policy briefings from experts in the field on those important issues.&nbsp; These consultations will continue until Inauguration Day 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Congressman Delaney delivered <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/05/01/talking-foreign-policy-at-johns-hopkins-sais/">a comprehensive speech</a> at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies on April 30, 2019, in which he presented the key elements of his foreign policy agenda. Delaney’s focus on foreign policy was also highlighted in Josh Rogin’s May 23<sup>rd</sup><br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/2020-democrats-must-run-on-foreign-policy-not-away-from-it/2019/05/23/e08775cc-7d88-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.465b5782c485">column</a> in <em>The Washington Post, </em>titled ‘2020 Democrats must run on foreign policy, not away from it.’<br><br>“During the duration of the 2020 presidential campaign Congressman Delaney will continue to share his vision for foreign policy and America&#8217;s responsibility as a leader in our global community.”</p>



<p>Delaney is scheduled to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations on Thursday, September 5, 2019 in New York.</p>

<h4><em>Delaney attending holiday events in New Hampshire on Memorial Day</em></h4>



<p> </p>



<p><strong>CHARLESTOWN, NH</strong> – John Delaney is attending Memorial Day events in Charlestown, Bow, and Portsmouth New Hampshire this holiday. <br><br>Delaney releases the following statement:<br><br>“Memorial Day is one of the most sacred days on the calendar, a day to reflect and remember. Today we honor the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice defending the country they loved, we honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice for us, we honor those who fought to keep our nation safe and free, and we are forever in their debt. </p>



<p>“At Memorial Day events across the country today, we see evidence that there is much more that unites us than divides us. The fallen that we remember today came from every town and city, from every background, from every faith, and the heroism, bravery, and service of those we honor today set an example for all of us. Finally, today is a powerful reminder that we must do everything we can to support our veterans and military families and make sure that their sacrifice is recognized and they receive the benefits they have earned.” </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, in a column in <em>The Washington Post</em> titled “2020 Democrats must run on foreign policy, not away from it,” Josh Rogin highlighted John Delaney’s foreign policy focus and expertise. Rogin writes that while most Democratic presidential candidates have “remained quiet” on foreign policy, “one exception has been former Maryland congressman John Delaney.” Rogin continues, “Delaney is running as an unabashed internationalist, centrist, moderate Democrat who believes in returning to the assertive, values-promoting, alliance-building foreign policy approach that majorities in both parties once traditionally supported.”<br><br>The piece comes after Delaney <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/05/01/talking-foreign-policy-at-johns-hopkins-sais/">laid out his detailed vision</a> for foreign policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.<br><br>To read the piece online, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/2020-democrats-must-run-on-foreign-policy-not-away-from-it/2019/05/23/e08775cc-7d88-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.b85354d33052">click here</a>.<br><br><br><br><strong>The Washington Post </strong><br><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/2020-democrats-must-run-on-foreign-policy-not-away-from-it/2019/05/23/e08775cc-7d88-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html?utm_term=.b85354d33052"><strong>2020 Democrats must run on foreign policy, not away from it</strong></a><br>By Josh Rogin<br>5/23/19<br><br>The conventional wisdom on presidential elections is that foreign policy doesn’t play a decisive role — and most Democratic presidential candidates have largely avoided it, so far. But in the 2020 presidential contest, foreign policy will feature more prominently than ever, and Democrats ignore it at their own peril.</p>



<p>In 2016, voters had a clear choice between a traditional foreign policy leader with tons of experience in Hillary Clinton vs. a candidate with no foreign policy experience who promised to radically change the way U.S. diplomacy was conducted. Although&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/nbc-wsj-polling-shows-clinton-foreign-policy-advantage-n584536">polls showed</a>&nbsp;voters trusted Clinton more as a commander in chief, she lost the election, and President Trump has been implementing his new vision for the United States’ role in the world ever since.</p>



<p>That’s been a mix of what Trump calls “nationalism”: a pivot away from values-based foreign policy advocacy, an embrace of populism abroad, support for authoritarian rulers, skepticism of international organizations such as NATO, and unilateralism in confronting threats such as Iran and the rise of China.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/poll-trump-foreign-policy-approval-rating-2020-8cea6883-ce3f-477b-8006-91fb66cec8c8.html">new poll this week&nbsp;</a>by the Democratic group&nbsp;<a href="https://nationalsecurityaction.org/">National Security Action</a>&nbsp;showed that Trump is vulnerable on foreign policy, even among his own supporters, especially when it comes to trade and Russia. And yet, Democratic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/politics/2020-presidential-hopefuls/">presidential candidates</a>&nbsp;— with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/democratic-candidates-aren-t-talking-about-foreign-policy-why-cone-n1007131">a couple of exceptions</a>&nbsp;— have remained quiet on these issues.</p>



<p>One exception has been former Maryland congressman John Delaney. He has been talking to voters about foreign policy since becoming the first Democratic candidate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-delaney-why-im-running-for-president/2017/07/28/02460ae4-73b7-11e7-8f39-eeb7d3a2d304_story.html?utm_term=.2db18945c2ae">to declare his candidacy</a>&nbsp;in July 2017. He is convinced it’s the most important 2020 issue.</p>



<p>“Foreign policy is the biggest part of the job. And that’s the irony of running for president,” he told me during an interview.</p>



<p>Delaney is running as an unabashed internationalist, centrist, moderate Democrat who believes in returning to the assertive, values-promoting, alliance-building foreign policy approach that majorities in both parties once traditionally supported. This month, he laid out a detailed agenda during&nbsp;<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/2019/05/01/talking-foreign-policy-at-johns-hopkins-sais/">a speech</a>&nbsp;at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced and International Studies.</p>



<p>The Center for American Progress&nbsp;<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/05/05/469218/america-adrift/">released a study</a>&nbsp;this month that showed Democratic voters do care about foreign policy, though they want to hear about how it relates to their security and prosperity — not about “maintaining the liberal international order.”</p>



<p>Delaney argues foreign policy is more intertwined than ever with economics and prosperity at home, and that Trump has co-opted the legitimate grievances of those left behind by globalization to advance his unilateralist, nationalist, populist agenda. But Delaney believes Democratic primary voters can be persuaded to fix the system rather than blow it up.</p>



<p>“The world has changed very rapidly and profoundly and we didn’t do the kind of things we should have done to prepare our citizens for this. As a result, a lot of them feel left behind and their response is to question everything,” he said. “The American people will allow you to think globally as long as they believe you are investing locally.”</p>



<p>Also, Democratic primary voters object to the way the president conducts himself on the world stage, Delaney said. Values, decency and morality are now foreign policy issues, as well.</p>



<p>That basic frame of a return to normalcy in foreign policy is similar to what the Democratic front-runner, former vice president Joe Biden, is running on, as well. But Biden has yet to articulate a specific foreign policy agenda, and when talking about China, for example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-dismisses-china-threat-again">he has stumbled</a>.</p>



<p>The two progressive candidates most active on foreign policy are Sens.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/bernie-sanders-imagines-a-progressive-new-approach-to-foreign-policy">Bernie Sanders</a>&nbsp;(I-Vt.) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2018/11/29/elizabeth-warren-foreign-policy-speech-american-university">Elizabeth Warren</a>&nbsp;(D-Mass.). They both want the Democratic Party to pursue a more progressive, less-interventionist, less-capitalist foreign policy that would represent a wholesale change, as opposed to the tweaks centrists are proposing.</p>



<p>The fault lines that would emerge if the Democratic primary did turn to a foreign policy focus are clear: the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade war with China, Israel, Venezuela, Iran, defense spending and perhaps Russia. The Democratic leadership in Congress has an interest in papering over these differences. When interparty differences emerge on Israel, for example, Republicans&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apnews.com/86aaea07c97f4dd5a537b1031d1fb295">are quick to pounce</a>.</p>



<p>Delaney argues that Trump’s nationalist tendencies and the negative results have pushed Democratic voters back toward a more centrist, traditional foreign policy position.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/blue-dog-democrats-are-poised-to-play-a-crucial-role-in-the-next-congress/2018/12/13/4d8168ae-ff1c-11e8-83c0-b06139e540e5_story.html?utm_term=.28a3ce22156f">It’s a fact</a>&nbsp;that more centrist Democrat national security candidates were elected during the midterm elections in 2018 than progressives.</p>



<p>“We were trending towards isolationism as a party, in many ways. But Trump’s brand of nationalism is being rejected by many Democratic primary voters,” Delaney said. “That’s a positive step for the party.”</p>



<p>The truth is, we don’t know which foreign policy Democratic voters favor because they haven’t been presented with a clear and honest choice. In 2020, foreign policy will be on the minds of all Americans, and if Democratic presidential candidates don’t engage in the debate, they will lose it.</p>

<h4><em>“This is a real plan that all Americans can support.”</em></h4>



<p></p>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney announces today the release of his $4 trillion Climate Change Plan, a comprehensive roadmap of policy solutions to address the climate change crisis. Delaney’s Climate Change plan focuses on six areas:<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>A Carbon Fee and Dividend&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Direct Air Capture/Negative Emissions Technology (NET)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increasing Renewable Energy Research Budget 5-Fold</strong></li><li><strong>Challenge Grants</strong></li><li><strong>A Climate Corps</strong></li><li><strong>A Carbon Throughway</strong><br>&nbsp;</li></ol>



<p>“We have to act on climate and we have to act now,” <strong>said Congressman John Delaney</strong>. “Failure to act threatens our prosperity, national security, food supply, and the natural world. We can’t wait to convince the climate deniers and we can’t put forth unrealistic solutions or plans that crush Americans economically. We need a real plan to hit our goals and we have to listen to actual scientists. This is a real plan that all Americans can support. It is full of new ideas and massive investments in innovation that will both deal with climate change and create jobs in the heartland and all across our country.  This will be a first 100 days priority in my administration.</p>



<p>“We have to leave the world better than we found it and we won&#8217;t do that unless we stop global warming. My administration will make rural and heartland America the center of a massive new industry – carbon capture.”</p>



<p>Congressman Delaney is serious about tackling climate change and was awarded the Climate Leadership Award by the Citizens Climate Lobby in 2017. While in Congress, Delaney introduced the first bipartisan carbon fee and dividend bill in a decade.  <br></p>



<h4 style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Climate Plan</strong></h4>



<p>John Delaney is serious about tackling climate change.  It’s a big problem and it requires big solutions, which is why Delaney is announcing his $4 trillion Climate Plan that is full of new ideas and innovative solutions.<br><br>According to the IPCC, limiting global warming to 1.5°C will require achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We are already seeing the early effects of climate change, and that level of rapid emissions reductions is necessary to avoid the catastrophic consequences that would result from any further delay. The difference between the warming we have already experienced and the 2°C warming we could see if we don’t act now to reduce emissions is a greater risk of water scarcity, increased sea-level rise, greater damage to ecosystems and animal habitats, declines in human health, and the displacement of millions of people. In addition to the environmental effects, the Department of Defense has characterized climate change as a threat multiplier. Delaney’s plan will put us on the right track to reduce emissions in time to avoid the worst consequences of global warming.<br></p>



<ol><li><strong>Carbon Fee and Dividend</strong><br>The largest component of Delaney’s climate plan that will have the biggest impact is his Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal. It is time we put a price on carbon to end polluters’ free ride. While in Congress, Delaney introduced the first bipartisan Carbon Fee and Dividend bill in over 10 years. The proposal starts the fee at $15 per metric ton of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent and increases the cost by $10 each year. Implementing a carbon fee, where the revenue is returned to the American people, is the best method for providing the market incentives to reduce our emissions. Delaney’s Carbon Fee will reduce carbon emissions by 90% by 2050. Taxpayers would also be given options with what to do with the dividend, including investing in a tax-advantaged savings account like a 529 for future education purposes or a retirement account. The Carbon Fee and Dividend proposal has bipartisan support from various industries in the private sector as well as the environmental community. However, we need more innovative solutions that will get us to net-zero emissions by 2050.<br></li><li><strong>Direct Air Capture/Negative Emissions Technology (NET)</strong><br>Reducing new carbon emissions and replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy will not be enough to limit global warming. According to the IPCC, to achieve net zero emissions and prevent warming in excess of 1.5°C we will need Negative Emissions Technology, including direct air capture, to remove a minimum of 100 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere. This technology is currently too expensive to be implemented at the necessary scale, which is why Delaney proposes ending the federal government’s fossil fuel subsidies and making an annual $5 billion investment in NET.   <br> &#8211; Delaney will promote NET, thus bringing down the cost, through a reverse auction program that gives first access to government subsidies to the companies that can capture and store atmospheric carbon for the lowest cost. <br>&#8211; By promoting innovation in NET and implementing the carbon fee, Delaney will create a powerful financial incentive to capture carbon instead of releasing it into the atmosphere. As emitting carbon becomes more expensive due to the increasing carbon fee, it will be more economical to capture the carbon and avoid paying the fee.<br></li><li><strong>Increasing Renewable Energy Research Budget 5-Fold</strong><br>We will solve climate change the American way, innovating our way out of the problem. This will require continued robust government support. Delaney proposes a 5-fold increase in DOE green energy programs, including the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, and the Office of Nuclear Energy. This investment will support research to improve energy storage, battery performance, sustainable transportation technology, grid efficiency, renewable energy, energy efficiency, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, and energy conservation technology.<br><br>To continue private sector investment in the renewable energy economy, Delaney will bolster renewable energy tax credits.<br> </li><li><strong>Challenge Grants</strong><br>To spur climate change innovation in the private and non-profit sectors, Delaney will create a new challenge grant program for significant innovations in:<br>&#8211; Preventing and stopping wildfires<br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from agriculture <br>&#8211; Reducing emissions from manufacturing <br>&#8211; Electrification of freight <br>&#8211; Energy storage and transmission<br> </li><li><strong>Climate Corps</strong><br>Delaney proposed the creation of the Climate Corps as part of his National Service Program. The new program would provide opportunities for recent high school graduates to work in low-income urban and rural communities where the Corps members would support these communities’ transition to a green economy, work on environmentally friendly projects, and fight climate change by working on the ground. Under-resourced communities for too long have suffered the most from pollution and climate change, all too often lacking clean water to drink and clean air to breathe. We must provide the manpower and resources to support these communities and recognize that all Americans have a right to a clean, safe, and healthy environment.<br> <br>In partnership with the government, community-based organizations, and local businesses, Climate Corps members can help communities:<br>&#8211; Identify the most pressing local needs that are hindering the community from transitioning to more environmentally friendly practices <br>&#8211; Provide information and support to families about sustainability, energy efficiency, and renewable energy <br>&#8211; Assist in clean energy projects including solar installation, improving building efficiency, developing community gardens, and increasing awareness about sustainable practices<br> </li><li><strong>Carbon Throughway</strong><br>Climate change skeptics often invoke the false choice of having to choose between jobs or the environment; we can create jobs AND fight climate change at the same time. That’s where the Carbon Throughway comes in.<br><br>The Carbon Throughway is a $20 billion infrastructure project that we will construct to safely transport captured CO<sub>2</sub> to sites for permanent sequestration and reuse. Building the Carbon Throughway will create tens of thousands of jobs and spur new R&amp;D and innovation in carbon capture. The project would be built with federal labor protections using American steel under a project labor agreement and pay workers prevailing wages. To the extent possible, the Throughway will be built along right of ways of existing pipelines and always abide by the strictest environmental standards. As the carbon fee raises the price of releasing emissions and new innovations in NET make carbon capture cost-effective, the Carbon Throughway will provide an additional financial incentive to capture carbon by facilitating its transfer for commercial uses and permanent sequestration.<br> </li></ol>
