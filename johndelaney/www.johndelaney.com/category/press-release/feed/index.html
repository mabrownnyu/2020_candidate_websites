<h4><em>Delaney Delivered In-Depth Foreign Policy Speech in April at Johns Hopkins</em></h4>



<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– John Delaney offered kudos today to Mayor Pete Buttigieg for joining him in bringing foreign policy substance to the primary. Delaney delivered a major foreign policy speech on April 30 at Johns Hopkins.&nbsp;<a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=b68d55b6e6&amp;e=fd6b7a55cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delaney’s foreign policy emphasis was covered recently by Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>“I look forward to reading Mayor Buttigieg’s remarks and I appreciate him joining me in an effort to talk about this on the trail,”&nbsp;<strong>said John Delaney.</strong>&nbsp;“Foreign policy is a huge part of what the White House does and we need a hundred times more discussion of it in this race. I’ve made laying out a robust foreign policy platform based on a strong national defense, rebuilding our alliances, free trade, and taking on China.”<br><br>In his April remarks, Delaney stated his opposition to defense spending cuts, called for rejoining the Paris Climate Accords and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, stressed the importance of US-Israel relations and announced his plan for a new aid and stabilization plan for Central America. Delaney pointedly criticized China’s “widespread and systematic program of intellectual property theft.”<br><br>Delaney argued, “based on irresponsible behavior by U.S. leaders, our allies are losing faith in our relationship and our actions are empowering our adversaries.”<br><br><a href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=9ebeb66174&amp;e=fd6b7a55cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Video here.</a><br><br>Delaney’s full remarks are copied below:</p>



<p><strong>“The Price of Greatness is Responsibility”</strong><br>Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies<br>Washington DC<br>April 30, 2019</p>



<p>Churchill’s words ring as true today as they did over 70 years ago. As a great nation, we must be a responsible nation. As leaders, we have a responsibility to tell the truth. To lead. To find common ground. To tackle problems and to engage in the world. If political leaders instead shirk these responsibilities – and engage in irresponsible behavior – our country suffers as does the world. This is what I am here to talk about today: responsible U.S. leadership.<br><br>Dean Nasr, Members of the Johns Hopkins Community,<br><br>Thank you for having me.<br><br>I am honored by the invitation to address this remarkable institution, as SAIS celebrates the 75th anniversary of its founding. Seventy-five years ago, the world was still embroiled in World War II. Here, at home, food rationing was being introduced. Race riots convulsed cities around the country. Despite turmoil both at home and abroad, Christian Herter and Paul Nitze had the foresight to establish SAIS. Their aim at the time was to ensure young Americans were prepared for a post-war world in which the United States would inevitably play a significant role.<br><br>The early years of this great school coincided with the shaping of the post-war so-called ‘liberal international order.’ Today, that order is under stress. Resurgent nationalism and populism are questioning the core principles of this framework. Revisionist powers are working to undermine the authority of its rules.<br><br>Herter and Nitze were men of great vision in world affairs &#8211; they served presidents of both parties, and were among a select group of wise leaders who conceived and enacted many of our nation’s major national security decisions in the second half of the 20th century. I can think of no better audience than the SAIS community with whom to engage in a conversation about the international challenges the United States faces in the 21st century and the foreign affairs vision I have for our country.<br><br>Let me start by introducing myself. I am the beneficiary of an America that worked – an immigration system that worked, a social compact that worked, and a miraculous American innovation machine that worked. All of which were created by responsible American leadership.<br><br>I am the grandson of immigrants. Two of my grandparents were born abroad, in England and Ireland. One of them, my grandfather Al Rowe, immigrated to the United States in 1923. He landed at Ellis Island as a teenager, with his seven brothers and sisters. While each of his brothers and sisters were allowed into the country, he was detained because he had a disability. He only had one arm. He appealed his deportation, and as fate would have it, his case was heard by a judge who also only had one arm. You can guess how his appeal went.<br><br>My family settled in the New York area and ended up in North Jersey. My grandfather worked in a pencil factory. We grew up a blue-collar family in a blue-collar neighborhood. My dad was a union electrician. Our family had health care because of his union and a scholarship from the IBEW helped me go to college. Something my parents never had the opportunity to do.<br><br>After college, I went to law school and then got into business, starting two companies from scratch. We were able to take those companies public &#8211; I was the youngest CEO of a NYSE company &#8211; and we were able to hire and employ a lot of people and achieve great success.<br><br>I’ve been blessed to have lived the American Dream. But I worry that stories like mine are out of reach for the next generation. In fact, today’s young people could be the first generation of Americans that won’t do better than their parents. And that is a failure of leadership. In many ways, the failure to reform our own economic system has led to our current misguided approach to foreign policy.<br><br>The 2020 presidential election takes place against the backdrop of significant changes in the world and at home. The global balance of power is shifting before our eyes, with Asia now rivaling the West as the world’s center of gravity. &nbsp;New powers are emerging, some posing unique challenges to the United States and the liberal international order. The extraordinary power of technological innovation has transformed everything in our world – economies, jobs, national security and human interaction.<br><br>These forces have connected people in ways we could never have imagined. They have worked together to create the greatest poverty elimination machine the world has ever seen. Anyone who thinks the condition of humankind has not fundamentally improved across the last 75 years is simply not looking at the facts. In 1950, only 25% of the world was interconnected globally and the global poverty rate was 66%. Today, these forces have led to 75% of the world becoming interconnected and the global poverty rate has fallen to 10%.<br><br>The facts clearly favor the optimist.<br><br>But this progress has come with challenges, including disrupting our economy and economies in the developed west. The last several decades have seen extraordinary concentration of opportunity, wealth and income making America, in many ways, a country of birthright and not opportunity. As an example of how profound the opportunity concentration is, last year, 80% of the venture capital was invested in 50 counties in our country – out of nearly 3,100. That story does not end well.<br><br>In the context of these economic trends, is it a surprise that many Americans are questioning everything we have done across the last several decades? Make no mistake about it my friends, these economic realities are central to our foreign policy challenges. They were brought by irresponsible politicians who failed to do the things we should have done – in education, healthcare, tax, fiscal and technology policy – to prepare our country for rapid and profound change. And as I used to say in business, the cost of doing nothing is not nothing.<br><br>These changes have collectively left us in many ways more vulnerable than ever before. Information, including the know-how to create and deliver weapons, is more easily shared. Disinformation campaigns, fueled by the ability of self-interested actors to masquerade as journalists and manipulate people’s opinions with falsehoods &#8211; and soon, completely realistic deep fakes, are powerful and effective. With advances in the area of cyberwarfare, all nations, even those unable to acquire arsenals of nuclear weapons, have the potential to change the fate of a nation and our world. And while free-market capitalism and the explosive growth in global trade have lifted billions from poverty into the middle class, we’ve learned that carbon derived energy that has fueled this prosperity is now causing an environmental crisis and soon a migration crisis. And the technology that has benefited us in so many ways is also now potentially causing hundreds of millions of people to have their jobs displaced or disrupted by automation and artificial intelligence.<br><br>In the face of these changes, U.S. leaders are called to responsibly address our own domestic economic affairs, rebuild the social compact for our citizens, and work with our partners to lead and ensure the security and prosperity of the world. &nbsp;And these two things are linked. In fact, I would argue that what is happening around the world has never been more important to the safety and prosperity of our citizens. In that regard, we ought to be thinking about how to adapt and reform our overall strategy, our forces and security architecture to a changing world and changing international threat environment. Unfortunately, we are lagging in these responsibilities. Many Western democracies are turning inward. Populism is on the rise everywhere.<br><br>And in the United States, we are gripped by a growing sense of nationalism, which I believe is the wrong answer to every question we could ask ourselves.<br><br><strong>2020: The Stakes Are High</strong><br><br>The stakes in the 2020 election thus could not be higher for all Americans, but especially for young Americans whose futures are on the line.<br><br>Another four years of political dysfunction with a complete inability to find common ground and solve some of the basic challenges in our country will undoubtedly continue many of the underlying trends I mentioned and prevent us from addressing the massive debts we are leaving the next generation.<br><br>Another four years of backward orientation, of trying to create a world that doesn’t exist anymore and wasn’t as good as it is romanticized, won’t work, instead we should be focusing on the future and harnessing amazing technological innovation to build a better world.<br><br>Another four years of highly divisive politics could lead us to a place where we can no longer discuss our differences in a civil matter or argue from a set of shared truths. It could leave us not fighting together for Team USA, as Ron Chernow warned on Saturday night in front of a room full of journalists.<br><br>We must not have a president who is hostile to critical institutions, to the first amendment, to the rule of law, to our ethnic and religious diversity and – most importantly &#8211; to truth itself. Americans deserve better.<br><br>In the areas of national security and foreign policy, I believe the stakes are particularly high.<br><br>For decades, the U.S. has worked to build an unmatched portfolio of allies – no other country in the world has anything like it. Our allies are foundational to our ability to operate around the world militarily, diplomatically and economically. They were built not solely out of friendship, but for our own self -interest. Today, based on irresponsible behavior by U.S. leaders, our allies are losing faith in our relationship and our actions are empowering our adversaries.<br><br>Across the last several decades, as America’s economic share of the world decreased – largely due to rapid economic growth in other parts of the world &#8211; our diplomatic power share maintained and even grew because of U.S. engagement and leadership. Think about how remarkable that is. But I would argue that if our global engagement decreases we should expect our diplomatic power to decrease to reflect our economic share.<br><br>If we continue on our current trajectory:<br><br>&#8211; It could mean a dismantling of the global security architecture created and led by the United States that has largely maintained peace and prosperity for us and our allies since the end of World War II.<br><br>&#8211; It could mean a nuclear arms race with Russia and China. &nbsp;<br><br>&#8211; It could mean the difference between a truly free world and one where despotic leaders have undue influence.<br><br>&#8211; It could lead to a migration or pandemic crisis where global institutions are rendered ineffective in their response capabilities.<br><br>&#8211; And it could mean environmental disaster should the U.S. continue to remain a bystander in the face of climate change.</p>



<p>Righting the ship will take work, but with responsible leadership, it is not only achievable but inevitable. The world is yearning for responsible U.S. leadership.<br><br>As President, I will lead the United States in a new direction. America will lead, not alienate. America will move forward, not inward. America will protect the homeland and defend its people and interests at home and abroad. This is an America that acts responsibly – yes responsibly is the keyword – in leading not only our country but also the global community.<br><br>This is what I am focused on presenting here today – a foreign policy vision based in American ideals and values, strength, and standing with our allies and alliances.<br><br>Before we get into specifics, let me briefly share with you some actions I will take. These actions indicate how I think about the world. I view these as responsible actions:<br><br>&#8211; I will rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership<br><br>&#8211; I will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, and I will lead a discussion globally as to how we can work together to develop negative emission technologies<br><br>&#8211; I will put arms control at the top of my national security agenda<br><br>&#8211; I will mobilize all federal resources to mount an effective cyber defense<br><br>&#8211; I will develop a new aid and stabilization plan for Central America that will stem the flow of migrants and asylum-seekers to our borders<br><br>&#8211; I will seek to rejoin the JCPOA, but negotiate tougher terms on Iran upon re-entry<br><br>&#8211; I will not seek reductions in defense spending and will work to reposition our military towards the threats of the future<br><br>&#8211; I will call for a new Authorization for Military Force<br><br>&#8211; I will make clear that we stand once again for our ideals and with our allies<br><br><br><strong>A 2020 Vision for National Security &#8211; Strength and Leadership Starts at Home</strong><br><br>I am running for President to offer my fellow Americans and the world something different &#8211; something strong and bold, something based on a deep understanding of the most important trends shaping our world, something that will reestablish the United States’ position as the leader of the international order. I am running to offer my country a responsible approach to the challenges and opportunities we face.  <br><br>My vision for our foreign policy and national security starts at home.<br><br>A strong homeland is the only basis on which we can sustain a strong national defense and global leadership. Bringing our country together, focusing on solutions, creating opportunity and encouraging responsibility, and restoring the American Dream of upward mobility for all are the fundamental pillars.  In other words, building an America that broadly succeeds economically again is an integral part of my foreign policy strategy. If our country is fiscally imprudent and moving in the wrong direction, if our infrastructure is old and falling apart, if our education and health care systems don’t work, we will sooner or later exhaust our capacity to project power and influence around the world.<br><br>As President, I will be committed to building a foundation for our country’s long-term prosperity. We will invest in education, research and development, cutting-edge technologies, infrastructure, vocational training, and workforce development. I will unleash a moon-shot project in innovation in clean energy technologies, negative emission technologies, and carbon capture and transmission. These will be built in America’s heartland, bringing enormous economic growth to struggling communities. And we will restore our country’s long-term fiscal health.<br><br>My approach to international relations is based on preserving the foundational principles that have informed U.S. policy for 75 years, while adapting our strategies to protect our interests in the 21st century. This means reaffirming and demonstrating who we are and what we stand for – a proud democracy that supports the cause of freedom and human rights.<br><br>&#8211; My vision ensures that our military remains preeminent, and that our men and women in the U.S. armed forces have the resources they need here and abroad; they will know that we have their backs.<br><br>&#8211; My vision ends the era of ill-advised wars of choice that do not advance our vital national interests. Our ability to prevent war depends to a great extent on the perception of our adversaries that we would defeat them in any conflict.<br><br>-My vision makes a commitment to diplomacy as the first resort.  Our diplomatic corps can be a powerful force in the world when backed by the world’s strongest military.<br><br>But the current Administration is squandering this advantage by hollowing out the State Department. I will support these patriots and I will restore the tools of statecraft needed to give policymakers options other than war.<br><br>&#8211; Similarly, my vision re-enfranchises the men and women of our Intelligence Community to ensure their best efforts to keep our nation secure in support of diplomatic and military efforts.<br><br>&#8211; My vision reaffirms support for our security alliances and supporting relations with allies. I will make it clear to friend and foe that the United States stands by its security commitments.<br><br>&#8211; And my vision reinforces global multilateral institutions that establish rules on issues of critical importance to Americans.  <br><br>&#8211; My vision revives arms control negotiations, putting them high on the national security agenda.<br><br>&#8211; My vision addresses the implications of growing friction with China in the military, economic and technological arenas.<br><br>&#8211; My vision embraces free trade and leverages trade agreements to support U.S. jobs, bolster U.S. exports and to compete in the global economy. Every meeting I have with a world leader will be staffed by my chief diplomat and my chief economic advisor, as I see diplomacy and the economy as inextricably linked.<br><br>&#8211; My vision includes a robust foreign aid program to support global poverty reduction initiatives and to help enhance food security, education, health and women’s rights across the globe, with a particular focus on Africa and South Asia.<br><br>&#8211; My vision calls for rejoining the fight against climate change.<br><br>This is a responsible vision. And by being responsible at home and in the world, America will prosper.<br><br><strong>New Directions in Strategy and Policy</strong><br><br>It is extremely important, however, that Democrats not make the mistake of assuming that all that needs to be done to bolster U.S. security is to reverse the misguided policies and positions of the current Administration.  Given fundamental changes in the global system that have been underway since before Trump took office, it is imperative that we also develop new approaches to emerging challenges.<br><br>Despite our current tense relations with Moscow and Beijing, I am calling for candid discussions with both governments. We must try to resolve points of friction or otherwise minimizing issues that have the potential to become triggers for conflict. In the case of Russia, I believe that an adversarial relationship goes against the long-term interests of both countries. Given the demographic and economic challenges Russia faces, it would benefit in the long term from close economic cooperation and friendly relations with the West. But I will make it clear that this can never happen while they interfere in our elections and those of our allies.  <br><br>The difference between my approach to Russia and Donald Trump’s is that I believe, as did Ronald Reagan and many of our Cold War leaders, that we can only negotiate successfully with Moscow from a position of significant strength. If we approach Russia from a position of strength–then we can have an honest dialogue about Russia’s interests and role in the world.  A responsible President is clear-eyed about Russia’s motives and tactics, but mindful that dialogue with Russia is always in our self-interest.<br><br>Similarly, we have to change our approach to dealing with China’s emergence as a global power. We need to initiate a serious discussion with China about the points of friction that have a very real potential to provoke conflict between our two countries. We must explore whether our differences can be negotiated successfully, or mitigated so as to avoid an unthinkable escalation between two giants. Any responsible conversation with China has to focus on China’s widespread and systematic program of intellectual property theft that has hurt our economy. China has become our rival by doing three things – they made smart investments, they worked hard but they didn’t play by the rules. We cannot allow them to not play by the rules during this next wave of transformative innovation. I will organize a new effort among our allies to hold China accountable. But I will also hold the U.S. private sector accountable. We have laws that prohibit U.S. executives from making payments to foreign leaders. Shouldn’t the same laws prevent them from depositing government funded intellectual property into joint ventures with Chinese companies knowing full well they will be stolen and misappropriated?<br><br>To close, I want to share with you my core foreign policy priorities my administration will have on day one. After all, leading is fundamentally about choosing and setting priorities. While these are not in any particular order, together they lay out a responsible agenda.<br><br>First, protect the interests and security of the United States. It is a fundamental responsibility of our government to make sure that our people are safe. Anyone seeking the job of Commander in Chief should have that responsibility at the top of mind. We have to take threats seriously. We have to take the fight to our enemies. And we have to make sure that the entire world knows of the extreme consequences associated with harming the United States and our people &#8211; just to be clear we have a zero tolerance policy.<br><br>This also means securing our borders. It can be done. The experts tell us that a combination of electronics, manpower, fencing, and barriers is needed to curtail unlawful entry into our country.  We also need comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. In parallel, I will launch Plan Central America, inspired by the previously successful Plan Colombia, to help the governments in that region overcome the lawlessness that is at the root of population outflow to the U.S.<br><br>Second, reassure NATO allies of our commitment to Article 5, the alliance and its anti-terrorism mission. Russia has defined itself as an adversary of the West. Russia continues its efforts to weaken NATO and its members by subversion. This cannot be tolerated. We must counter these actions aggressively.<br><br>Third, revive arms control negotiations with Russia and pursue them with China.  We are at risk of a new nuclear arms race with Russia. We must determine whether the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) is salvageable. I also pledge to seek a new strategic arms agreement between the U.S. and Russia. New Start is the last remaining major U.S.- Russian arms control agreement with major limitations and verification procedures.  It expires on February 5, 2021 – just days after the next president takes office. I will also explore the possibility of arms control with China, particularly in the area of intermediate-range missiles.<br><br>Fourth, address Middle East issues.  The Middle East requires the U.S. to remain engaged on issues of concern and we have brave men and women at risk there, and other places in the world, every day.  In each such decision I make in the Middle East, there will be clear goals. For example, in Syria we should not reduce forces until we have a clear understanding of how the Kurds will be protected, that the threat of ISIS is eliminated, that the large numbers of ISIS detainees are dealt with properly and that Iran doesn’t have a military presence on the Israel border.  In Iraq and Afghanistan, our long-term goals are force reduction but accompanied by on-going presence focused on security and anti-terrorism training. I support reviving U.S. participation in the JCPOA.  We can leverage our return to the negotiating table to obtain improvements to the deal as well as to address Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region and beyond.<br><br>As for our strategic partnership with Israel, it will remain strong and bipartisan under my presidency.  I am completely committed to the security of Israel and recognize them as one of the most important and enduring allies to the United States. I am firmly against efforts to delegitimize Israel, such as BDS. The issue of how to achieve peace with the Palestinians, who inhabit the same geographic space, remains on the table. For decades, the United States invested considerably in an effort to achieve a two-state solution, which I have always supported and continue to support. But ultimately, for any solution to succeed, it must be the result of direct negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.<br><br>Fifth, sustain our resolve and focus on defeating terrorists. The tragic killings in Sri Lanka should remind us that we’re in a long-term, worldwide fight requiring determination and endurance.<br><br>Sixth, pursue a get-tough approach with China that aims to eliminate Chinese theft of U.S. technology and intellectual property and unfair barriers to American exports and investment. China acts like pirates. Trump’s trade war, however, is proving extremely costly to American producers, workers, and consumers, and I greatly fear that he will settle for short-term Chinese concessions in exchange for surrendering the high ground on technology.  We need to negotiate with China from a position of strength, and that means ending trade wars with our closest friends and allies so that we can join forces in confronting Beijing. It also means rejoining the TPP.<br><br>Seventh, lead the fight against global warming.  I will resume U.S. participation in the Paris Climate Agreement, and I pledge that my Administration will harness American ingenuity and international leadership to save our planet from irreversible effects of global warming. I believe that by implementing a carbon tax, investing in green energy research and unleashing the power of negative emissions technologies, the United States can help save the world from the catastrophic effects of climate change. This is a problem that in many ways only old-fashioned U.S. led innovation can solve and if we do it, we will have the added benefit of owning the most valuable technology in the world.<br><br>Eighth, meet the challenge of cyberwarfare.  I will propose the creation of a Department of Cybersecurity to bring all U.S. domestic capabilities under a single roof and develop a unified strategy to protect the homeland under a single chain of command.  We need to be prepared to go on the offensive – to carry this fight to adversaries who have come to feel that they can attack us in cyberspace with impunity. While the proposed Department of Cybersecurity will not conduct offensive missions – leaving that to the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community – it will coordinate with those agencies on all aspects of our nation’s response to cybersecurity threats. Russia will not be dissuaded from attacking our elections unless we make it too painful for them to do so.<br><br>Ninth, continue to strengthen our military. A report last year from the National Defense Strategy Commission warned that “America has reached the point of a full-blown national security crisis.” The report warns of decreased air-superiority, lagging investments in the next generation of weapons systems, and advances made by Russia and China that threaten the United States’ historically immense comparative advantage. It is imperative that the United States both strategically focus on the weapons needed for the next generation of warfare and get our fiscal house in order so that we can fund them.  <br><br>My friends, the United States is facing a stunning number of serious challenges in the world today. As Churchill said in that very same speech declaring the need for responsible leadership, “The people of the United States cannot escape world responsibility.” Russia seeks a reduction of our role in Europe and China wants to supplant us in Asia.<br><br>Our military has been stretched and underinvested in since the sequester began. Meanwhile, there is growing risk of an actual war between India and Pakistan, while our standoff with the nuclear-armed and unpredictable regime in North Korea continues. There are tremendous risks to the next generation and our planet posed by the dangers of global warming. We have seen what one failed state can do to global stability. Imagine the global impact of multiple highly populous states failing due climate change. The next generation also faces unsustainably high levels of sovereign debt which could limit many developed governments ability to respond to crisis. Finally, some estimate that 800 million jobs could be disrupted in the next several decades by automation and artificial intelligence.<br><br>We cannot hope to surmount these difficulties if we do not restore our democracy to health and become more united as a people.  In Churchill’s words, &#8220;If we are together nothing is impossible. If we are divided all will fail.&#8221;<br><br>We know that the U.S. can respond to the call for unity and cooperation because we’ve done it before. In 1958, then Senator John F. Kennedy spoke in Baltimore shortly after the Soviets had successfully launched Sputnik. Kennedy said, “let us not despair but act. Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer.”<br><br>It is time for us to respond to today’s challenges with a similar spirit. To work together around a sense of common purpose. Where we leave narrow interests and partisanship behind.<br><br>That is what responsible leaders do.<br><br>That is what I am offering to my party, and what I hope to offer the country.  <br><br>Thank you very much.</p>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD – </strong>Yesterday, at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Hall of Fame dinner, presidential candidate John Delaney <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/JohnDelaney/status/1137867847609327616" target="_blank">called for the creation of a universal health care system</a> that preserves private insurance options.<br></p>



<p><strong>John Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“Some in my party are rejecting opportunities for real progress around common sense solutions by disparagingly labeling these ideas as ‘middle-ground.’&nbsp;<strong>This is fundamentally dishonest.&nbsp;</strong>First, if we learned anything from the midterm elections it is the fact that moderate candidates flipped seats from red to blue by talking about common sense solutions, not purity tests. Second, purity tests are bad public policy because they stifle debate, lead to intellectually dishonest solutions, and bad ideas, which will lead to the reelection of Donald Trump<br><br><strong>“Senator Sanders’ Medicare-for-all plan makes for a good talking point but is in fact bad policy and bad politics.&nbsp;</strong>Americans don’t want Donald Trump or Mike Pence having a say in or controlling everyone’s health care benefits, which would happen if we had a single-payer system.&nbsp;Americans want choices and they want us to continue to improve health care quality.&nbsp;My plan, BetterCare, creates universal health care by providing every American government run health insurance, keeps&nbsp;the private market in place for any American who likes their insurance and want choices, and ensures robust investment in health care.&nbsp;It’s not just smart politics, but its smart policy and it is what most countries do with universal healthcare.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif" alt=""/></figure>



<p><strong>Delaney’s remarks about his universal health care plan from the Hall of Fame dinner are transcribed below:</strong><br><br>“But most importantly, we need a president who is committed to creating universal health care in the United States of America. Where everyone gets health care as a basic right of citizenship. No Americans should be worried about whether they can pay for their insulin. Or worry about their children&#8217;s health care, or worry about whether if they make a decision to get health care that they may be signing up to bankrupt themselves. No American should worry about that, and we know we can do this.<br><br>“Why do we know that? Because other countries have done it. France has a universal health care system, Sweden has a universal health care system, the Netherlands has a universal health care system, and Germany has a universal health care system, so we can build a universal health care system in the wealthiest nation in the world.<br><br>“But the one thing, the one thing, about all of those countries whose systems we admire, none of them have a single-payer universal health care system, which shows there are lots of ways of creating universal health care in this country.<br><br>“My plan, BetterCare, gives every American health care as a right. It invests in our communities and ensures we have high-quality health care. It puts money against basic research so we can cure cancer and cure Alzheimer&#8217;s. And it gives the American people what they want, which is choices. That&#8217;s the best way forward on universal health care.”<br></p>

<p><strong>DES MOINES, IA</strong>– Today, at the Iowa Democratic Party’s Hall of Fame dinner, John Delaney spoke on the need to build a big tent coalition that is able to govern effectively. Delaney also emphasized the need to create a universal health care system that provides health care as a right of citizenship while preserving private insurance options. <br><br>Delaney’s plan for universal health care includes steps to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/prescription-drugs/">lower prescription drug prices</a> and improve access to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/mental-health/">mental health care</a>. The full plan can be found online<a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/"> here</a>.<br><br>Delaney has also released comprehensive policy platforms to <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/climate-change/">combat climate change</a>, <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/gun-safety/">reduce gun violence</a>, <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/infrastructure/">rebuild America’s infrastructure</a>, and <a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/heartland-fair-deal/">revitalize rural America</a>.<br><br><br><strong>Delaney’s remarks are transcribed below:</strong><br><br>So, I have been everywhere. Good afternoon, Iowa. How&#8217;s everyone doing? All right, good. So one of the great privileges of traveling to all 99 counties is that I&#8217;ve seen so many familiar faces here this afternoon and it has been great to talk to you, particularly in rural Iowa, and don&#8217;t let anyone tell you that rural Iowa doesn&#8217;t matter anymore because I think it does &#8211; there you go &#8211; and talk about how we build the big tent Democratic Party that we need to win and govern.<br><br>So I stand before you as someone who has lived the American dream and I am so grateful for all the opportunities this country has given me. To be the first in my family to go to college, to be a successful entrepreneur, to serve my country in the Congress of the United States, and most importantly, to be blessed with an amazing family.<br><br>But these stories are so much harder for young people today. Why? Because we stopped doing our job. We stopped doing the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for the future. I stand before you here today as someone who does not believe that what hard-working Americans need is more ideology, more gridlock, or more partisanship. They need solutions, and maybe that&#8217;s because of where I&#8217;m from. They do. And maybe that&#8217;s because of where I&#8217;m from.<br><br>My dad was a union electrician &#8211; IBEW. He wired buildings for a living. He did honest work. And when you do honest work, you get a building that works. You flip on a switch, the lights go on, you turn on a faucet, the water comes out. One of the problems with our president is he doesn&#8217;t build anything. He doesn&#8217;t care if anything works. He only cares about himself. We need to ensure that America works for hard-working Americans. We do.<br><br>We need to elect a president who’s committed to investing and improving public education in this country. We need to elect a president who is committed to combating climate change, to reforming our broken immigration system, to investing in all communities, including rural America, and with dealing with all of the change that&#8217;s coming from technology.<br><br>But most importantly, we need a president who is committed to creating universal health care in the United States of America. Where everyone gets health care as a basic right of citizenship. No Americans should be worried about whether they can pay for their insulin. Or worry about their children&#8217;s health care, or worry about whether if they make a decision to get health care that they may be signing up to bankrupt themselves. No American should worry about that, and we know we can do this.<br><br>Why do we know that? Because other countries have done it. France has a universal health care system, Sweden has a universal health care system, the Netherlands has a universal health care system, and Germany has a universal health care system, so we can build a universal health care system in the wealthiest nation in the world.<br><br>But the one thing, the one thing, about all of those countries whose systems we admire, none of them have a single-payer universal health care system, which shows there are lots of ways of creating universal health care in this country.<br><br>My plan, Bettercare, gives every American health care as a right. It invests in our communities and ensures we have high-quality health care. It puts money against basic research so we can cure cancer and cure Alzheimer&#8217;s. And it gives the American people what they want, which is choices. That&#8217;s the best way forward on universal health care.<br><br>And so we need &#8212; we need to become the party of ideas, the party that embraces the debate, the party that wants to build a big tent so that Progressives who want change, moderates who want solutions, independents who just want their elected officials to put the country first, and even those disaffected Republicans who look at this president and see that he has no moral compass and have turned their back on that party. If we become that party, we’re going to win every election. And more importantly, we&#8217;ll be able to govern.<br><br>Because whether it is creating universal health care, or dealing with climate change, or investing in communities that are left behind, or rebuilding our infrastructure, reforming our immigration system, creating universal pre-K, having more early childhood education, making community college free, launching national service, or dealing with all the blessings of technology and making sure the American people are equipped to deal with it. On all of these issues, there&#8217;s a common-sense way forward and let&#8217;s build that big coalition party and govern and lead this country.<br><br> God bless you.<br></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – June 7 is Gun Violence Awareness Day and John Delaney announces today his comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence in America. <br><br>“A majority of the American people want us to address gun violence and to take concrete actions to make our communities safer,” said John Delaney. “It is time to get this done, because no one should feel unsafe at school, at work, at the movies or anywhere else. We can’t let tragedy after tragedy happen and do nothing.” <br><br>Delaney’s plan includes:</p>



<ul><li>Universal Background Checks </li><li>An Assault Weapons Ban</li><li>Banning Bump Stocks</li><li>Closing the Boyfriend Loophole</li><li>Enacting a National Extreme Risk Protection Order Law</li><li>Ending the ban on Gun Violence Research<br></li></ul>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>John Delaney’s Gun Safety Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>The time has come for action on gun violence. According to the CDC, guns were responsible for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/11/18135976/gun-deaths-us-2017-suicide" target="_blank">nearly 40,000 deaths</a> in 2017, more than the number of deaths <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/12/11/18135976/gun-deaths-us-2017-suicide">caused by automobile accidents</a>. Large, bipartisan majorities support a broad range of common sense gun safety measures, but political partisanship has prevented the government from taking the necessary steps. Delaney believes it is possible to respect the Second Amendment and still adopt meaningful reforms.<br></p>



<p><strong>Universal Background Checks</strong><br>97 percent of the American people agree that we need universal background checks on gun sales, including closing the loophole for private sellers. Federal background checks stopped more than <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694290.pdf" target="_blank">112,000 gun sales</a> out of approximately 8.6 million transactions in 2017, demonstrating that universal background checks <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694290.pdf">are an effective tool</a> to keep guns out of the wrong hands while still allowing law-abiding citizens their Second Amendment rights.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney supports requiring background checks for every gun sale.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Assault Weapons</strong><br>&nbsp;High-powered, military-style assault weapons have no place on our streets. Since the expiration of the original assault weapons ban in 2004, mass shootings have become far more deadly. Different variations of one type of assault weapon, the AR-15, have been used in some of America’s deadliest mass shootings, including Parkland, Sutherland Springs, Orlando, and Newtown.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney cosponsored the Assault Weapons Ban Act, which would ban semiautomatic weapons that have military-style features, including the AR-15.</li><li>This legislation also includes a ban on high-capacity magazines.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Bump Stocks</strong><br>These accessories, which allow individuals to modify standard semi-automatic rifles to mimic the rate of fire of a machine gun, were used in the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in American history. Machine guns have been banned in the US for decades, and it is time that we prohibit accessories that can undermine this critical safety measure.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney will support legislation to codify a new regulation that bans all accessories designed to increase the rate of fire of a semiautomatic weapon, including bump stocks and trigger cranks.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Extreme Risk Laws</strong><br>&nbsp;When a person knows that a family member poses an immediate threat to themselves or others, they should have a legal means to protect their safety by temporarily restricting access to guns. This has already been successfully implemented in Maryland with bipartisan support.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney is calling for a national extreme risk protection order law that would provide grants to support state, local, and tribal governments that adopt extreme risk laws, which allow family members and law enforcement officers to petition courts for temporary protective orders to restrict gun access for at-risk individuals.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Boyfriend Loophole</strong><br>&nbsp;Current federal law prevents certain convicted domestic abusers from buying guns, but the ban only applies to individuals convicted of abusing their spouse and does not cover instances of domestic violence in non-married couples. Intimate partner violence does not limit itself to married couples, and the gun safety measures in federal law shouldn’t be limited either.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney supports updating the Violence Against Women Act to extend the ban on convicted domestic abusers buying firearms to cover non-spouse partners.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Gun Violence Research</strong><br>Though the ban on CDC research into gun violence was finally lifted in 2018, Congress still has not provided funding. Providing full support for federal research would help prevent violence and save lives.</p>



<ul><li>Delaney will ensure that the government funds this vital field of research.</li></ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><br>“<em>Sen. Sanders’ Medicare For All Bill is bad policy and bad politics and will help get Donald Trump re-elected</em>”<br><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD –</strong> In light of new debates about the best form of universal health care, John Delaney highlights his health care plan that provides universal coverage but gives Americans a mix of government and private options. This year, Delaney has announced comprehensive plans to establish <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/" target="_blank">universal health care</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/mental-health/" target="_blank">expand mental health care coverage</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/prescription-drugs/" target="_blank">lower prescription drug prices. </a></p>



<p>Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“We can’t afford to play politics with our health care system.&nbsp;<strong>Sen. Sanders’ Medicare For All Bill is bad policy and bad politics and will help get Donald Trump re-elected.&nbsp;To beat Trump we must have an honest debate about the best way to ensure everyone has health care while also preserving options.&nbsp;</strong>Voters need to hear the truth, not more political slogans. My universal health care plan is the best path forward and would actually be the biggest and most progressive expansion of government health care coverage since the creation of Medicare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Americans want choices when it comes to health care, not a government-only-approach. My universal health care plan gives every American health care as a right, but still allows them to have private insurance if they so choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe in the politics of addition, that we should be providing healthcare benefits to those who are uninsured or lack basic coverage, not telling 150 Million Americans that their health insurance is illegal, which the Medicare For All legislation explicitly does. That is the politics of subtraction.&nbsp; I don’t believe that the American people will support a system where they have to give up their health insurance, where low reimbursement rates will lead to hospital closures, or where a single President (like President Trump) is in charge of our entire health care system. These are my opinions and I believe the Democratic Party should be tolerant to everyone’s opinions if we want to chart the best path forward.”</p>



<p></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><strong>Delaney Health Care Plan</strong></p>



<p><br>I believe that health care is a fundamental right. I am proposing a universal health care plan that will provide high-quality care to everyone and replace our outdated system of employer-sponsored insurance. As President, I would roll this plan out to the American people after we fix the damage that the GOP has done to the Affordable Care Act and improve upon it. This way, Americans would once again get the benefits of the ACA while the nation and Congress have the time it takes to reform health care. Tying access to health insurance to employment forces workers to stay in jobs they don’t like, distracts entrepreneurs from their main focus of running their businesses, and prevents wages from increasing.<br></p>



<ul><li>Create a new public&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;plan for all Americans under the age of 65 while preserving traditional Medicare. My new plan would protect the reforms delivered by the Affordable&nbsp;Care&nbsp;Act, including guaranteed coverage of preexisting conditions and essential&nbsp;health benefits, and would make access truly universal. At 65, people would transition into Medicare. Medicaid would be absorbed by the new plan. The highly trusted Medicare provider network could be used for the new plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Guarantee universal coverage. Individuals would be automatically enrolled in the new public plan, with no complicated procedures to follow.</li><li>Keep&nbsp;private insurance options. Individuals and employers will be able to purchase and negotiate supplemental coverage from private insurers to cover additional&nbsp;health&nbsp;needs. These supplementals could merge into the basic plan to make it easier for the user.&nbsp;</li><li>Employers would be encouraged to negotiate group rate supplemental plans that would merge with the basic governmental plan so that employees would be able to keep their&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;plans, many of which are very popular and important to American families.</li></ul>



<p>In order to be sustainable, universal&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;needs to be paid for. My plan will lower the overall cost of&nbsp;health&nbsp;care&nbsp;and put the government on a responsible fiscal path.</p>



<p>Pay-fors&nbsp;(numbers are based on a 10-year projection):</p>



<ul><li>The&nbsp;tax subsidy for employer-sponsored insurance costs the&nbsp;government&nbsp;more than $3.7 trillion and depresses wages for working Americans.</li><li>Allowing&nbsp;the government to negotiate drug prices would stop the transfer of wealth from working families to corporate executives and shareholders of pharmaceutical companies. This would save the government nearly $850 billion.</li><li>This&nbsp;plan would replace the ACA, and savings from ending the ACA’s tax subsidies would total $760 billion.</li><li>Current&nbsp;federal Medicaid spending is projected to be more than $4 trillion, which this plan would absorb.</li><li>States&nbsp;are projected to contribute more than $3.7 trillion to Medicaid. States would continue to pay their share for the current Medicaid population and the federal government would cover the cost of expanded coverage.</li><li>Implement&nbsp;a means-tested copay requirement for&nbsp;higher-income individuals to fund an increase in reimbursement rates for primary care&nbsp;providers.</li></ul>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – John Delaney was applauded for his courage in an editorial published in today&#8217;s print edition of the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>. Referring to Delaney’s criticism of the Medicare for All legislation authored by Senator Sanders, the editorial board wrote that Delaney deserved credit for telling his fellow Democrats “hard truths.”<br><br>This weekend at the California Democratic Party Convention, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=b75020e664&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">Delaney spoke out against single-payer Medicare for All.</a> Delaney has released a mixed-model <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://johnkdelaney.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=278eec984ed421149dac97eef&amp;id=7d28c7b460&amp;e=030aabee24" target="_blank">universal health care plan</a>.

Perhaps John Delaney and John Hickenlooper expected the jeering, given their remarks. Still, they deserve credit for telling their copartisans hard truths.<br><br>Mr. Delaney, a former Congressman from Maryland, is polling at 0.5% in the Real Clear Politics average. He told the convention that he supports universal health care, universal prekindergarten and free community college. But then he dismissed “slogans posing as policies.” A few minutes later: “Medicare for All may sound good. But it’s actually not good policy, nor is it good politics.”<br><br>Thus commenced two minutes of enthusiastic booing. As Mr. Delaney tried to explain over the din, millions of Americans have private insurance, which Medicare for All would abolish. “We should have universal health care,” he said. “But it shouldn’t be a kind of health care that kicks 150 million Americans off their health care. That’s not smart policy.”<br><br>Mr. Delaney expanded on this theme during an April visit to the Journal. He said Medicare for All is “based on a presumption that the government will pay enough for health care.” Yet both Medicaid and Medicare, he said, reimburse doctors at below cost: “We have ample evidence to suggest that if the government was the only payer in health care, it would never pay enough, and that would lead to a reduction in quality and access.” This is bitter medicine for San Francisco progressives, but it’s the unflinching reality.<br><br>The jeering was nearly as loud for John Hickenlooper, a former Governor of Colorado who’s also polling at 0.5%. He told the convention that President Trump is “threatening our democracy,” not to mention “dismantling our health care, destroying our planet, and creating a culture of hate.” <br><br>Then Mr. Hickenlooper added: “If we want to beat Donald Trump and achieve big progressive goals, socialism is not the answer.” <em>Booo!</em><br><br>“We shouldn’t try to achieve universal coverage by removing private insurance from over 150 million Americans.” <em>Boooo!</em><br><br>“We should not try to tackle climate change by guaranteeing every American a government job.” <em>Booooo!</em><br>At one point, Mr. Hickenlooper broke from his speech to address the hecklers: “You know, if we’re not careful, we’re going to end up helping to re-elect the worst President in American history.”<br><br>The activists who attend these party conventions are well to the left of the average Democrat. Maybe that’s why Joe Biden, who leads the 2020 field, didn’t show up in San Francisco. At least Messrs. Delaney and Hickenlooper had the guts to face down the socialist crowd.<br><br> ###</p>

<h4><em>“We</em>’<em>ve got to be able to have a robust policy debate out in the open, that</em>’<em>s what this primary process should be about.”</em></h4>



<p></p>



<p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO, CA</strong>&nbsp;– Today, at the California Democratic Party Convention, John Delaney spoke on the need for Democrats to be a big tent party and called for a universal health care plan that doesn’t take the approach of Medicare for All, which would make private insurance illegal. (Delaney’s remarks as prepared for delivery are copied below.)<br><br><a href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/health-care/">John Delaney’s universal health care plan</a>&nbsp;guarantees all Americans health care coverage as a right and also allows for people to have options and to purchase private insurance. Currently, over 150 million Americans have private insurance. The Sanders Medicare for All bill in the Senate would force them off of their private insurance and onto a government plan.<br><br><strong>Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“It was an honor to speak at the California Democratic Party Convention, truly. There was incredible energy all weekend and it was exciting to meet with so many high school kids who are working hard to make this country a better place. We’re strongest as a big tent party that can bring people together and I think most Democrats understand that, but some are more interested in purity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This isn’t a game &#8211; the policies we choose will impact hundreds of millions of people. We’ve got to be able to have a robust policy debate out in the open, that’s what this primary process should be about. A few boos aren’t a big deal, making a really bad mistake on health care is. We can’t be dedicated to slogans and must ensure that a real debate happens. Most of the Democrats in this field either don’t want to take this on or are trying to play it both ways, but I don’t think that’s responsible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a universal health care plan that guarantees everyone a basic government health care plan as a right, but also allows people to have options and doesn’t make private health insurance illegal. I think that’s better policy because study after study confirms that if all the health care bills in this country were paid at Medicare rates, then huge numbers of hospitals would close. I also think we should not be telling 150 million Americans that have private insurance (<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/245195/americans-rate-healthcare-quite-positively.aspx">and 70% of them like it</a>) that their healthcare is illegal. It will be up to the American people to choose what they want, and I respect different views, but I’m not going to back down from my goal to create a universal healthcare system that works for every American.”&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Michael Starr Hopkins, Delaney’s National Press Secretary, releases the following statement:</strong></p>



<p>“The Democratic party is a big tent party with a range of viewpoints. What we saw in San Francisco while not surprising, was certainly disappointing. <br><br>“If Democrats think shouting down our own candidates is the path to beat Trump, it’s going to be a long primary season. We need a battle of ideas, not a circular firing squad. We as a party are better than what we witnessed today.”<br></p>



<p style="text-align:center"><br><strong>Delaney Remarks as Prepared for Delivery at California Democratic Party Convention</strong></p>



<p><br>Good morning, thank you for having me.<br><br>I come here today as someone who has lived the American dream and feels blessed by the opportunities this magnificent country has given me:<br><br>To learn, to get a great education despite the fact that my parents didn’t go to college<br><br>To earn, to become an entrepreneur build two deeply admired companies and create thousands of jobs<br><br>To serve in the Congress &#8212; working to see that everyone has the same opportunities to succeed that this working-class kid from New Jersey had. <br><br>And most importantly to be happily married to an amazing woman and raise four terrific daughters.<br><br>My story – the story of the American dream – is being pushed out of reach for young families and for the middle class. In fact, young people today will be the first generation of Americans to not do better than their parents. They are also left fiscal and climate debts they can’t repay. </p>



<p>How did this happen? Because we failed to do the basic things we should have done to prepare our citizens for a world that changed rapidly because of technological innovation and globalization.<br><br>A responsible government would have done things decades ago to fix healthcare, help workers by doubling the Earned Income Tax Credit, improve public education, address climate change and reform our broken immigration system. Each step of the way, efforts to do this were either blocked specifically by Republicans in Congress or by excessive partisanship generally.<br><br>I’m here today because I don’t believe that more hyper-partisan politics, ideological purity or slogans posing as policies, can do the things that America’s families need to have done. It takes real solutions.<br><br>“Moderate” “bipartisan” “problem solver” “Responsible” are the words that follow me around the campaign and I’m proud all of these labels. Because, more than anything, I believe in getting things done. If it takes policies more moderate than some of my colleague’s advocate, pushed through Congress with bipartisan support to get something done,&nbsp;<strong>then I am all in.&nbsp;</strong>Because I believe in the&nbsp;<strong>politics for progress.</strong><br><br>I think it was growing up the son of a union electrician that made me this way.<br><br>My dad ran wires through buildings, installed breaker boxes, hooked up HVAC systems to outside power sources.&nbsp; He wasn’t a glamorous guy. It wasn’t a glamorous job.&nbsp; He worked with his hands. There were no highbrow intellectual discussions at our table. His political lesson was simple:&nbsp; if you care about workers, you vote for the Democrats. Period. That, by the way is the Democratic party that wins every election.<br><br>But my dad did honest work.&nbsp;<br><br>And when you do honest day’s work, you get things done.&nbsp; You get a building that works.&nbsp; When you flip a switch, the lights come on. When you twist a faucet, water comes out.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Our current president doesn’t build, he brands.</strong>&nbsp;All he cares about is pasting his name in big gold letters on office towers, casinos, the wall. He doesn’t care if anything works. He puts his own self-interest ahead of everything.<br><br>That’s why his companies went bankrupt, while mine flourished. That’s why he stiffed working people like my dad, while my companies helped put thousands of people into good jobs and were admired in their communities. And its why his policies don’t work.<br><br>Ask the farmers who’ve seen prices go south ever since Donald Trump was sworn in if America’s working.&nbsp;<br><br>Ask the 40% of Americans who can’t afford basic needs, like housing, healthcare, food, and utilities if America works for them.<br><br>Ask the workers whose wages are not keeping up with inflation, while companies post record profits – if America is working for them.<br><br>But we can’t build an America that works for families from bumper sticker blueprints for castles in the sand.&nbsp; “Medicare for all” – which sounds good &#8211; will force hospitals across America to close their doors because Medicare payments alone won’t cover hospitals’ expenses and will cause 150 million Americans to lose their health insurance, which 70% of them like. Is that good policy? Or more importantly, Is that a formula for winning elections?&nbsp; My plan will ensure basic coverage for every American as a right but allow supplemental coverage and other options to provide choices while also that generates revenues that will keep hospitals open and fund research and innovation.<br><br>You see, I don’t want to be the most ideologically pure president. I want to be the president that makes things work. That gets things done.&nbsp; That is the responsible leader your kids deserve.</p>



<p>We didn’t flip the House with candidates that ran on rigid platforms. They won because they built coalitions, pursued center-left policies and campaigned everywhere. And promised to pursue common-sense plans that work.<br><br>We can do that in 2020. We can run, win, and govern on a government that works again for working families, for union members, for small farmers, and for young people.<br><br>That’s my kind of radical.<br><br>That’s why my campaign says: If you’re a progressive Democrat who wants real change, come on board.  If you’re a centrist Democrat who wants to get things done, come on board.  If you’re an independent who wants politicians to put their country ahead of their party, come on board. <br><br>And, if you’re a Republican disgusted by a president with no moral compass and a party that’s become a force for bigotry and privilege and corruption. and you want to restore a sense of decency and respect to the office of the presidency, come on board.  That is the coalition we need to win in 2020 and to govern going forward.  Because this election will be fought right down the center.<br><br>But we have to stop talking and start doing.  We have to be honest about the problems and honest about the solutions. And we have to bring people together to find, as JFK put it, “not the Republican answer or the Democratic answer, but the right answer.”<br><br>If we can do that, if we can work together towards honest solutions that create opportunity and restore the middle class, we make the magnificent machinery of our democracy sing once again.<br><br></p>

<p><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/politics/trump-mexico-tariffs.html" target="_blank">President Trump announced a potential 5 percent tariff</a> on all imported goods from Mexico. The tariff would gradually increase until all undocumented immigration stops. As one of the few 2020 candidates to support President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership, John Delaney has made trade policy a priority on the campaign trail as tariffs have devastated the midwest. <br><br><strong>Delaney releases the following statement:</strong><br><br>“Just when we thought Trump couldn’t make his trade war policies and his immigration policies worse, Trump decides to lump them together into one.  <em>We all know that Trump doesn’t understand how any of these policies actually affect working Americans.</em>  It’s time for Congress to stop Trump’s trade wars and to come together in a bipartisan manner to pass comprehensive immigration reform and pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”<br></p>
