<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong>&nbsp;– In response to President Trump’s refusal to work with Democrats until the completion of&nbsp;congressional investigations, presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:<br><br>“The President’s decision to not work with Democrats is just another example in the long line of temper tantrums coming from the White House. Bipartisan solutions are the only way that we can pass meaningful legislation that will improve the lives of all Americans. President Trump’s failure to reach across party lines will hurt every American town with a failing bridge, every teacher hoping for broadband internet in her rural school, and every parent in places like Flint, praying for help from Washington. Democrats have a responsibility to investigate the President’s improper behavior.&nbsp; To hold up bipartisan action that will help the American people for your own self-interested reasons is fundamentally unpatriotic.”</p>

The Congressman noted underlying crimes in special counsel Robert Mueller&#8217;s investigation into whether Trump&#8217;s 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia. In response, John Delaney released the following statement:<br> <br>“Congressman Amash is a principled conservative, and I admire the fact that he speaks his beliefs. He is certainly not the only Republican who believes that the President has obstructed justice, undermines the separation of powers, or otherwise engages in highly inappropriate behavior; but he is one of the few who takes a stand. It is time for principled Republicans to similarly take a stand and defend the Constitution, the institutions of government, the rule of law, and the norms of our society.<br><br>“If we continue to allow this President to be unchecked and manipulate the truth, we will forever alter our Democracy for the worse.”<br> ###</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD –</strong> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.newsweek.com/trump-administration-farmers-bailout-brazil-brothers-1427346" target="_blank">According to reports</a>, the Trump administration redirected $62 million that was earmarked for struggling farmers to provide a bailout for a Brazilian meatpacking company. The company, JBS, is currently under investigation by the Justice Department for possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.<br><br>Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:<br><br>“The Trump administration’s decision to divert $62 million in funds meant for struggling American farmers and give it to a foreign company – that appears to be doing well financially and is also under investigation for corruption – is another example of the President’s questionable version of ‘America First.’<br><br>“Congress should open an investigation into the administration’s $62 million foreign bailout. American farmers have suffered immensely under the President’s trade war with China and every cent of precious taxpayer money needs to be used to deliver the most positive impacts for American farmers and workers. It is clear that the Trump Administration has been one of the worst administrations for farmers, from tearing up the TPP to engaging in a ‘go it alone’ trade war. The buck stops with the President and he must be held accountable.”</p>

This behavior is reckless and irresponsible. </p>



<p>“The most sacred duty of the President is serving as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States. It is an extraordinary responsibility; charged with defending our nation and directing the brave men and women who serve our country with honor, commitment, and excellence. They are not political pawns and should not be treated as such. The American people should ask themselves why the President is doing what he is doing.”<br> </p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – Yesterday, the Canadian government announced the creation of a new Advisory Council on Artificial Intelligence. The council includes representatives from the private sector and researchers and is tasked with promoting economic growth and job opportunities and a human-centric approach to machine learning. </p>



<p>John Delaney, the founder of the AI Caucus in Congress, has called for similar efforts from the United States. As part of his platform, Delaney has pushed for the implementation of a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.johndelaney.com/issues/artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">National AI Strategy</a>. Last year, Delaney published an op-ed in <em>Wired </em>titled, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-needs-an-ai-strategy/" target="_blank">France, China and the EU All Have an AI Strategy. Shouldn’t the US?”</a><br><br>“When it comes to artificial intelligence, we can’t fall behind,” <strong>said John Delaney.</strong> “We’ve been the global leader in technological innovation, research, and entrepreneurship, but that doesn’t mean we will be at the top forever. Right next door, Canada is taking action. They’re developing AI superclusters and focusing on commercialization. This should be a wake-up call. <br><br>“Our economic competitors around the world recognize the importance of AI and we need to as well. History shows that new technologies create more jobs than they displace, but to make sure that those new jobs are being created here in America, we need a proactive approach. We must make sure we’re investing in research, preparing workers for the future, and developing guidelines on ethics and privacy. The current White House is focused on the past, we need to be focused on the future.” </p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD – </strong>Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement:</p>



<p>“The abortion bans being implemented in Alabama and Georgia are an all-out attack on women and their freedom. Plain and simple. It places control over a woman’s physical body in the hands of the state. These bans are unconstitutional and infringements on a woman’s right to privacy.  Decisions regarding women’s reproductive health should be made by the woman and her doctor, not politicians. Banning legal abortions will not stop abortions, it only stops women from having safe abortions. I will fight for women’s rights every single day and every step of the way.”</p>

<h4><em>Half the Democratic field is just like Trump on trade, protectionists stuck in the 80s</em></h4>



<p style="text-align:left"><br><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – With President Trump’s protectionist trade policies damaging the country economically, John Delaney asks if the many 2020 Democrats who opposed President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and espoused anti-trade policy regret their past views. By 2:00 PM Eastern, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down over 600 points, following months of economic problems for farmers in the Midwest due to the tariff fight. <br><br>Delaney was one of a small number of House Democrats who voted in favor of giving the Obama Administration Trade Promotion Authority in 2015 and also supported TPP. Trump campaigned against the TPP in 2016 and pulled the US out of the agreement in 2017. Many Democrats took his position. <br><br>“Democratic voters deserve to know if their candidates have an Obama trade policy or a Trump trade policy. Close to half the current field stood on the floor of the US Senate and cast a vote saying they didn’t trust President Obama to negotiate a good trade deal. It’s absurd.<br><br>“Frankly, we’re in the mess we’re in because of an alliance between the far left and the far right that came together to kill the TPP – which would have been an incredible leverage point in negotiating with China. Trump trashed Obama and a lot of Democrats basically went along with it hook, line, and sinker. It killed the deal politically. <br><br>“When it comes to trade, half our field is just like Trump: stuck in the 80s. <br><br>“Here’s what I’d do: get back in the TPP, end the tariff fight, and focus on real problems like IP theft and China’s military aggression in the South China Sea.”</p>

<p><strong>FRIENDSHIP HEIGHTS, MD</strong> – President Trump escalated his trade war with China this morning, raising tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods. <strong>Presidential candidate John Delaney releases the following statement</strong>:<br><br>“It is clear that Donald Trump has little to no understanding of how the economy works or what the true risk from China really is. His trade war is hurting rural America and causing a rise in bankruptcies for farmers. We cannot continue down this path.<br><br>“The fact that the President bankrupted his various companies doesn’t mean that we should allow him to bankrupt Americans all across this country. If the President is as great a deal maker as he claims, he should close this deal and allow Iowans to stay in their homes. Instead, the President is overly fixated on the trade deficit &#8211; as opposed to intellectual property theft &#8211; and is abandoning the American worker.”<br> </p>
