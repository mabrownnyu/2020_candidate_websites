								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>John has an unmatched record of bi-partisanship among the Democrats running for President (and certainly against President Trump). When he was running for a third term in 2016, he received the endorsement of the <em>Washington Post</em> editorial board due to his willingness to reach across the aisle:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>In just two terms representing the state’s 6th District, which stretches from Montgomery County to the West Virginia line, Mr. Delaney has established a reputation as one of Capitol Hill’s most substantive, proactive and bipartisan newcomers.</p><cite>Editorial Board. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/behold-a-bipartisan-congressman/2016/11/03/30de3566-a144-11e6-8d63-3e0a660f1f04_story.html?utm_term=.eb8977f6293d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="&quot;Behold, a bipartisan congressman&quot; (opens in a new tab)">&#8220;Behold, a bipartisan congressman&#8221;</a> <em>Washington Post</em>, 3 Nov. 2016</cite></blockquote>



<p>Additionally, GovTrack named him the 3rd most bipartisan Democrat in Congress during his time on the Hill. Working together is what he knows. So when someone asked him, &#8220;how will you mend the fences in Washington,&#8221; at a town hall in Newton, IA, the answer came easy.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have had the privilege of trying to live a meaningful life in public service—of being able to fight for the moms, the dads, and the kids for whom life is hard. I know what they need and what they want because I’ve been through it too as a four-time parent and son of a union electrician.</p>
<p>Americans work hard to give their children a chance at a better life. They deserve a society that will protect and support them and prepare them for the future. We must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a national AI strategy and plan for emerging technologies</li>
<li>Overhaul our public education system</li>
<li>Provide universal healthcare and delink it from employment</li>
<li>Invest more in places that have been left behind</li>
<li>Reduce immoral long-term national debts</li>
</ul>
<p>All families deserve a shot at their dreams, and they deserve a country that supports them in that pursuit. If we come together, we can make a difference. https://youtu.be/qGeEl6J2_h8</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Laws and institutions must go hand-in-hand with the progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths discovered and manners and opinions change, with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also to keep pace with the times.”</p>
<p>Thomas Jefferson wrote those words in 1816. How right he was.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our world is rapidly evolving, but in so many ways we’re still stuck using frameworks and mindsets from the past. We should be thinking about where the world is going and update the laws and institutions in our society for those changes. That&#8217;s our fundamental responsibility and we did that for a long period of time, but not lately. Think about how the world has changed.</span></p>
<p>Automation, technological innovation, and globalization are the most powerful forces in the world today and are fundamentally changing the way the world works. I believe these changes are ultimately positive but many people will be hurt by them because we are not preparing our citizens. Decades of hyper-partisanship has led to our government failing to take the steps necessary to ensure broad prosperity in a globally-connected, high-tech economy.</p>
<p>Let’s renew the American social contract and update the institutions in our society so that all Americans can lead prosperous lives.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My focus is on preparing our country for the future. Technological innovation, automation and globalization are the most powerful forces in the world today. These forces have been enormously positive; they will continue to make life better, enhance productivity, solve some of the world’s most difficult problems and open societies. These forces will also eliminate certain jobs and require workers to learn new skills more quickly. They will create security risks and strain our resources. We need to respond to these large-scale opportunities and challenges by thinking about policy from a fresh perspective. What are the resources we have, how do we compete and create jobs, how can we ensure that everyone has a fair chance, and how do we protect ourselves?</p>
<p>We need to be smarter, fueled by insights from the government, non-profits and the private sector. We need more investment in science, education and research. We need new ideas on the future of jobs and work, one where we build a stronger and more vibrant middle class. We need to encourage a more just and inclusive form of capitalism and reduce barriers to small-business formation, start-ups, job creation, investment and growth. We need to strengthen our safety-net programs and create a new social contract. We need to reform the systems of education, health care and immigration, and encourage more volunteerism, impact investing and public service. And we need to take affirmative steps to reduce our security, fiscal and climate risks. This is what my campaign will be about.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the son of a union worker, John knows a job is more than just a paycheck, it’s also about dignity and purpose. That&#8217;s why creating high-quality jobs was such a priority to hom as an entrepreneur and businessman. His second business, CapitalSource, was given an award by the Obama administration for investment in low-income and economically distressed communities. It was also voted one of Washingtonian Magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Best Places to Work.&#8221;</p>
<p>John is dedicated to making an economy that lifts up all Americans. Good-paying jobs, improved training and apprenticeships, raising the minimum wage, paid family leave, and universal health care are all part of the equation, as is making sure that working people can retire with dignity.</p>
