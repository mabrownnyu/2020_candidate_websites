								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, we held our long-anticipated outdoor rally in Washington Square Park in New York.  Our team had been planning this event for weeks in advance.  We were working around the clock to make it a success.  Then, we woke up Tuesday morning to find it was going to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We became worried that nobody would show up—but instead, when I arrived at the rally site, there were nearly 3,000 supporters gathered in the pouring rain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="The Crowd at Andrew Yang's Washington Square Park Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed_15.jpg?1557960557" alt="A field of umbrellas stretches across Washington Square Park - supporters waiting to hear Andrew Yang speak" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I realized we never should have doubted.  The Yang Gang is energized and ready to win this election.  A little rain won’t stop us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the rain had an upside: it shocked the reporters who were covering the rally in the media tent in the back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reporter even told my staff that he could not believe our massive turnout.  His exact words? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of this makes any sense!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Washington Square Park" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed-9.jpg?1557958675" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of a crowd in Washington Square Park, delivering a speech as the rain falls" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media is just catching on to what all of us have known for a long time now.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win this whole election and implement the Freedom Dividend to guarantee $1,000 per month for all Americans.  We can change this country and build a human-centered economy for all. </span></p>
<p><strong>We are drawing some of the largest crowds in the race and polling at 3% when most Americans have never heard of me.  </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the next few months, we are going to build on our momentum by hiring organizers in the critical early states, expanding our social media presence, and getting coverage in major national press outlets.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>But to achieve all those things, we need to be focused on one major goal between now and the FEC reporting deadline at the end of June—we need to raise $3.5 million.  Click here to contribute and help us reach our new goal.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it’s a pretty big number, but if we can meet this goal, we will DOUBLE our numbers from last quarter.  Imagine if we make it.  Think about turning on CNN and seeing their reports that our fundraising numbers in July have captured the attention of the country. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>So I’m asking you today—chip in to help us raise $3.5M by the end of June.</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If everyone on this list donates $20, we will hit our goal instantly.  That is the MATH.  With your help, we make the case that we are the candidate to beat in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and hope you had a wonderful Mother’s Day weekend!  I spent it with both Evelyn and my mom.  We should all call our moms more often.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I was back in New Hampshire for our best trip yet.  At each stop, I talked about going to high school in New Hampshire and my path from my high school days to running for President.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We got our biggest crowds yet:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang in New Hampshire" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/543/attachments/original/190511_New_Hampshire_rally.jpg?1557765875" alt="Andrew Yang is surrounded by supporters after a rally in New Hampshire" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Addresses New Hampshirites" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/543/attachments/original/190511_New_Hampshire_church.jpg?1557763222" alt="Andrew Yang addresses supporters in New Hampshire" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And people noticed.  The events were written up in <a title="Yang starts to attract attention in NH" href="https://www.wmur.com/article/yang-starts-to-attract-attention-in-nh/27425380">Manchester</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang pitches ‘trickle up’ economy" href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190510/andrew-yang-pitches-trickle-up-economy">Seacoast Online</a>, <a title="Yang touts his 'tech check' at town hall event in Hollis" href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/national/yang-touts-his-tech-check-at-town-hall-event-in/article_b06e6bf2-b9d7-5c9b-9b12-4591ddd430be.html">Union Leader</a>, and other New Hampshire publications, as well as <a title="How Andrew Yang's Online Following Has Turned Into a Real-Life Coalition" href="http://time.com/5587792/andrew-yang-presidential-candidate/">TIME</a>, <a title="Once seen as extreme 2020 long shot, Yang is attracting some buzz" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/once-seen-as-extreme-2020-long-shot-yang-is-attracting-some-buzz">Fox</a>, and <a title="Is Andrew Yang ‘Too Nice’ to Beat President Trump?" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/andrew-yang-2020-president.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.  Among the descriptions:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Progressive, inclusive, and incredibly creative and smart.  His enthusiasm is not divisive &#8230; Yang is one to watch.”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Lightning in a bottle.”</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He&#8217;s my front-runner.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Yang has his eyes on the future.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He&#8217;s the first political candidate to actually get [many people] excited.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;[His campaign is] actually listening to people, taking people seriously, thoughtfully and in an analytical way.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He’s outside the box in a way that, whew, really charged, really evoked amazing insight.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also got a mention on Bill Maher as someone on the rise.  I’m scheduled to go on Bill Maher in early June.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere we went in New Hampshire, we were met with growing crowds and excitement.  I credit Steve Marchand for much of the buzz.  Steve ran for governor as a Democrat in 2018 and has now endorsed me. I haven’t been that big a fan of seeking political endorsements—I’m not sure how much they matter to voters, particularly the folks who have embraced our campaign.  But in Steve’s case, it is more personal than that; so many people like and admire him as someone they have worked with.  At every stop, people greeted him with hugs and smiles.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Steve and our NH State Director, Khrystina Snell, have deep relationships all over the state.  They will get us in front of the right people on every visit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have never felt better about our trajectory in New Hampshire.  This trip was electric.  We will contend and shock the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, we are gearing up for our <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in NYC" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">biggest rally yet in New York City</a> on Tuesday—ABC and many other major news outlets will be there, and 5,000 supporters have RSVPed.  It is going to be epic.  And then it’s on to <a title="Events Page with South Carolina Events Listed" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">our first visit to South Carolina</a> where we are presently <a title="‘The safe choice:’ Biden widens SC lead in 2020 Democratic presidential primary" href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/the-safe-choice-biden-widens-sc-lead-in-democratic-presidential/article_f727895c-731f-11e9-888a-af4280777b2a.html">polling at 2%</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your belief in me and the campaign have made all of this possible.  Thank you.  If you can make a donation today, please do so—we have the chance to make history.  Let’s make the most of it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your charged up candidate,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">We were in Des Moines the other day wrapping up a town hall.  It was Zach, Carly, Luke, and I.  It was raining and chilly.  Our white Chevy Suburban was parked far across the parking lot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at each other for a second.  Were we all going to go to the car in the rain?  Or was someone going to run to the car and drive it over for the rest of us?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zach quickly said, “I’ll run out and get the car,” and then dashed into the rain while the rest of us waited.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After he pulled up, we piled in.  Carly said, “That was such a dad move, Zach.”  It’s true.  That’s the sort of thing I do with my family all of the time.  I go and get the car in harsh elements while they wait under shelter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So then I said, “Wait a minute.  If Zach is the Dad of this family, what am I?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Zach and Andrew Share a Bite to Eat" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/519/attachments/original/Image_from_iOS.jpg?1557330020" alt="Zach sits in the driver's seat eating food with Andrew" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And then it dawned on me—I&#8217;m the baby.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I realized a bunch of things very quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">People are taking care of me all of the time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Staffers have my favorite foods around.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">If I get in a bad mood, everyone around me suffers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">My schedule determines everyone else’s.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Others are grooming me, sometimes several times a day.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The parallels were eerie.  Zach is the patient Dad.  Carly, the energetic sister.  Luke is the quiet son.  And I am the kid around which the world revolves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to understand how close you get on the campaign trail.  You literally wake up together in an Airbnb, eat together, ride together in a car for hours on end, and coordinate every part of your day.  It is very intense.  You are in tight proximity to each other for hours and hours.  I’ve noticed that some other candidates travel with actual family members for this reason.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad to say that the team and I enjoy our time on the road, even when it gets tiring.  We get along famously.  Good thing, because we travel a lot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m incredibly grateful to the people on the campaign team.  Most joined before I had any level of public recognition.  They saw something in me and my ideas.  Many took huge pay cuts because they saw the chance to have a huge impact.  Their talent level and idealism are both sky high.  This campaign attracts amazing people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m accustomed to being the father figure—the CEO of a business, the head of a non-profit, and, of course, being an actual dad.  I hope to be the leader of a revolution that transforms the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many times on the campaign where I’m the person being taken care of instead of the opposite.  And I’m grateful for it.  Let someone else run into the rain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re heading throughout New Hampshire to <a title="Andrew Yang Dartmouth Town Hall" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-at-dartmouth-tickets-60974555537">Hanover</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang and the Upper Valley Democrats" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/yang-in-the-upper-valley-nh-tickets-61004211238">Lebanon</a>, <a title="Meet &amp; Greet with Andrew Yang in Concord" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/coffee-with-andrew-yang-tickets-61115505121">Concord</a>, <a title="Humanity First Rally in Portsmouth" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-portsmouth-nh-tickets-61004410835">Portsmouth</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang and the Sullivan County Democrats" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-claremont-nh-tickets-61004641525">Claremont</a>, <a title="Town Hall with Andrew Yang in Hollis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-hall-with-andrew-yang-tickets-61050374313">Hollis</a>, <a title="Meet &amp; Greet with Andrew Yang in Windham" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-windham-nh-tickets-61114022687">Windham</a>, and <a title="Pot Luck Supper with Andrew Yang in Milford" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-milford-nh-tickets-61044854804">Milford</a>. If you can make it, or have a friend in the area, please do come or let them know.  We will be traveling with Steve Marchand, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Hampshire who just endorsed me.  His endorsement made the nightly <a title="Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Marchand endorses Andrew Yang" href="https://www.wmur.com/article/former-democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-steve-marchand-endorses-andrew-yang/27172864"><u>news</u> in New Hampshire</a> and <a title="We’ve updated our N.H. primary rankings and there’s a new front-runner" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/new-hampshire/2019/05/03/updated-our-primary-rankings-and-there-new-frontrunner/cTA3STmZQoApt4jUbtpJdI/story.html">the Boston Globe</a> and has made waves throughout the state.  Thanks to Steve, we are growing in New Hampshire very quickly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s to a growing family,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for the support!  It means a ton to us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend was a lot of fun.  We started in Seattle where we were greeted by a crowd of thousands.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Seattle" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/490/attachments/original/IMG_3385.jpg?1557152215" alt="Andrew Yang, with Seattle in the background, delivers a speech to supporters" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rally in Seattle was enormous on a beautiful day.  <a title="K5 News Story on Andrew Yang's Seattle Rally" href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/2020-presidential-hopeful-andrew-yang-campaigns-in-seattle/281-8f9e25aa-e307-4059-a496-b8622750469b">We made the evening news</a>, which is always great.  I enjoy the thought of people turning on their evening news and seeing a crowd of thousands of their neighbors rallying for the Freedom Dividend and a more human economy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The YangGang has been strong in Seattle from Day One.  It may be because Seattle itself is being transformed by the advent of technology.  Housing costs have skyrocketed in certain areas.  A friend of mine who works at Amazon said, “It’s no secret that we are trying to make our own jobs obsolete.  Management doesn’t pretend otherwise.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A neuroscientist in Seattle said to me, “We need Universal Basic Income in the worst way.  The biggest obstacle is the human mind.”  He meant that we are wired for resource scarcity.  He’s right.  Moving people toward abundance is both our greatest challenge and opportunity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Next, it was on to Detroit, which has been on the receiving end of automation.  It was the epicenter of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs that have disappeared.  Its population has declined from 1.8 million to less than half that.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have spent a lot of time in Detroit—I’ve been there every year since 2011 with Venture for America. The city has made a lot of progress since then.  We drew hundreds of people to the Detroit Shipping Company.  Among the people I met there were Lacey, a truck driver who sees what is coming down the pike, and Derek, a military vet who has become an activist for mental health issues.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">I learned a lot from the people of Detroit over the years.  They have been doing the hard work building up their neighborhoods and communities.  Some people regard Detroit as a symbol of America’s industrial past—it is more accurately an emblem of America’s future as our economy continues to transform.  Many towns and communities in the Midwest will increasingly resemble Detroit if we automate truck driving and the trucks don’t need to stop anymore.  As Derek said, “It’s incredible what we let happen to Detroit.  Half the suburbs in this country are going to look like Detroit if we don’t do something about it.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One issue that is common to Detroit and many other communities—urban blight.  It is expensive to tear down buildings properly.  If a municipal budget goes down, it becomes almost impossible to remove derelict buildings that then bring down property values and become havens for crime.  Detroit alone has about 30,000 derelict homes and buildings, with 30,000 more on the edge of abandonment.  One thing that I will do as President is commit Federal funds to a domestic infrastructure force that can help communities clear out or repurpose derelict buildings for redevelopment.  We need to become better at helping communities reconfigure themselves in the new economy.  It will also create work in many environments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We will be back in Detroit for the DNC debates in July, and I’m excited for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, it was on to Minneapolis.  The #YangGang there is strong—1,000 people came out to Boom Island Park.  Minnesota has been a blue state for a while, but recently it has become more competitive as many rural voters went to Trump.  Minneapolis is something of the progressive haven in the state.  I talked about why the folks in other parts of the state seem to be increasingly distressed. They see an economy that doesn’t work for them or their kids as rural areas become more depleted and main street stores close.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Minneapolis" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/490/attachments/original/190505_MSP_%281%29.jpg?1557153233" alt="Andrew Yang's crowd of supporters in Minneapolis" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota votes early in the primaries on Super Tuesday in March.  Also of note—Minneapolis is only 2 hours from the Iowa border.  If the #YangGang gets excited enough, we could draw people from Minnesota to campaign in Iowa ahead of the caucuses.  We will come back to Minneapolis—St. Paul for sure; I enjoyed the heck out of it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was invigorating to see so many Americans pumped up about me and the campaign all over the country.  We can make the changes that we seek together if we wake up our fellow citizens to the power that we collectively wield.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our campaign is gaining steam all of the time.  <a title="Presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s plan for universal basic income" href="https://www.today.com/video/presidential-candidate-andrew-yang-s-plan-for-universal-basic-income-58900549612">We were featured on the Today Show</a> this Sunday, and I’ll be doing more media this week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">heading to New Hampshire later this week</a>, and then, on May 14<sup>th</sup>, we will have <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in New York City" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">our biggest rally yet in Washington Square Park</a> in New York City.  Thousands of people from around the country will be there. Tell your friends in New York to make the trip—it will be a ton of fun.  We are going to bring the media to the rally—let’s build a crowd that will make them stand up and take notice.  It’s not Left or Right; it’s Forward.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your forward-looking candidate,</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/490/attachments/original/andrewyangsignature.jpg?1557149311" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="136" height="75" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello and thank you for your support!  It means a ton to me and the team.</p>
<p>I’m writing this on the plane out West—we are having a rally in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Seattle" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-seattle-wa-tickets-59624294871">Seattle on Friday</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Detroit" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-detroit-michigan-tickets-60845631923">Detroit on Saturday</a>, and <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Minneapolis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-minneapolis-mn-tickets-59674699633">Minneapolis on Sunday</a>, and are stopping in the Bay Area for a day first to say hello to some people there.</p>
<p>Someone asked the other day whether it’s me writing these emails.  Yep.  It’s me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Writing a Newsletter" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/473/attachments/original/IMG_2859.jpg?1556796605" alt="An over-the-shoulder shot of Andrew writing this very newsletter on his laptop on a plane to California" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I tend to write these emails in transit from one place to another.  I enjoy processing what’s happening in the campaign.  I find it a useful way to recharge.</p>
<p>I was talking to my wife last night about introverts who are/were politicians.  It’s probably not the norm.  Having met Barack Obama several times, I believe that he qualifies.  After meeting him, my wife said, “For an introvert, he seemed very personable.”</p>
<p>I was a very nerdy, bookish kid.  My favorite thing to do was read books.  As a kid, I devoured biographies of Native American leaders and fantasy books: Dragonlance, Piers Anthony, Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey.  I played <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with my brother and our neighbors growing up, and later moved on to video games.</p>
<p>I struggled with various social interactions throughout my adolescence, particularly when people started drinking.  I went from nerdy kid to somewhat mopey adolescent, listening to the Smiths and the Cure.  I was in the high school play and joined the debate team.  But I was still the last person that anyone thought would become a politician much less run for President. My high school yearbook <a title="The Yearbook Photos of the 2020 Presidential Candidates" href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/the-yearbook-photos-of-the-2020-presidential-candidates.html">photo recently appeared in <em>New York Magazine</em></a>. I suppose my fashion choices are proof that I’d never intended to run for anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/473/attachments/original/yang_high_school.png?1556813972" alt="yang_high_school.png" width="269" height="457" /></p>
<p>I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder, and started working out and playing basketball in my late-teens. Going to the gym became another way to process things.</p>
<p>I noticed recently that my emails have become a bit similar.  They say something like, “Look how much awesome progress we are making!  Here are some news clippings and photos!  We are going to grow and grow and shock the world!”</p>
<p>All of which is real and sincere.  I mean, it’s staggering how far we’ve come.  Now that we are cool, I realize just how uncool we were until recently. #YangGang.  I appreciate all of the creativity and artwork that people are producing—including the good memes.  People being excited enough about this campaign to put their time and energy into it is awesome.  Thank you for believing in me.</p>
<p>But there will be more to this campaign and my speaking to you than simply cataloging our recent achievements.</p>
<p>My recent emails have fallen into what I’d consider “Executive Mode.”  Building an organization—or a presidential campaign—includes advancing certain variables and deliverables.  As an executive, you focus on them and try to move them forward.</p>
<p>Let’s say you were running for President:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you become known to more Americans?  Let’s do some press interviews, starting with podcasts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you become politically viable?  Let’s make 11 trips each to New Hampshire and Iowa and start schmoozing with Democratic activists there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you raise millions of dollars to fund a campaign?  Let’s put a vision out to our fellow Americans that gets people excited about building a movement for a new human-centered economy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you build a massive following?  <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Hold big and exciting rallies around the country</a> for thousands of supporters.  The press will see the crowds and respond.</p>
<p>Making progress on these variables requires a constant array of distinct behaviors.  E.g., yesterday, I woke up, went to a TV studio, put makeup and hairspray on, and had a 6-minute conversation on a cable news program.  Then I filmed various messages for online ads.  Then I did a Town Hall.  My communications become a summary of these activities.  “We did this, and then we did this and we made progress. Isn’t it great?”</p>
<p>This is a written form of executive communication.  I will do my fair share of it—it is my job—but I promise to go beyond it to give you some genuine insight into what running for President actually entails and what the process is.  It will be better for me too.</p>
<p>As an adult, I remained an introvert, but I found myself developing different capacities.  Mainly because I revolted when I found out it was supposed to be my job to process other people’s documentation as a corporate attorney.  I was like, “No way this is what I’m going to do for a living.  I need to figure something else out.”  I was willing to adopt behaviors that were very uncomfortable for me at the time to reach certain goals.  Putting myself out there.  Selling an idea for a company.  Asking women out on dates. (I am now grateful to be married.)  Over time, those behaviors became, if not second nature, at least things I could do in service of something I felt strongly about.</p>
<p>I even started throwing parties in my late twenties.  It was a way to socialize and be cool when I didn’t have an apartment to host anything (I wasn’t making much money).  I remember distinctly walking home alone, late at night, stone cold sober after a big party that had included hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Throwing parties was perhaps the best training for a presidential campaign.  Years later, my organization Venture for America had an annual gala that drew hundreds of people.  I’d give a speech each year.  Starting and running a national non-profit involved a lot of speaking and presenting a vision.  I joked that I felt like a priest, where my job was to show up and bless things.</p>
<p>This is, I believe, how an introvert finds himself running for President.  You have certain goals.  You realize that the only way to make them happen is certain behaviors. You get better at those behaviors. Eventually, you find yourself with a goal so big that it is almost impossible—prepare society for the automation of labor that is already tearing us apart.  Keep the country whole.  There is a vanishingly short list of ways to meaningfully do so.</p>
<p>I’ve said in various forums that I don’t much care for the actual job of being a politician.  It’s true.  I think one of the reasons we despair for our future is that politicians traffic in certain behaviors and get rewarded for them.  There is little need for deep thought or consideration.  We lurch from press release to press release, from cable news appearance to cable news appearance, from speech to speech, with the constant buzz of our approval and popularity in the background.  And money is tied to that approval.  At first, I was horrified that how many social media follows I got was now a key deliverable.  I was like, “I’m a grown man now evaluating myself like an eighth-grader.”  (<em>Eighth Grade</em> was a good movie.)</p>
<p>But I adapted. Because I have a job to do.</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>I will do what it takes to get this job done.  We are off to a tremendous start thanks to all of you.  We have the capacity to change the course of our country for the better.  But I need your help.</p>
<p>The title of this email was taken from a slogan adopted by the fans of an NBA Team, the 76ers, who had a highly introverted GM for a number of years, Sam Hinkie.  He wrote <a title="Sam Hinkie's Resignation Letter" href="https://www.espn.com/pdf/2016/0406/nba_hinkie_redact.pdf">a resignation letter</a> that became something of a cult hit.  Many of his ideas have since been adopted by other teams.</p>
<p>This campaign is going to be a triumph of big ideas and solutions over the churn of politics as usual.  There is an enormous appetite for a different kind of movement.  Let’s provide it.  It’s not Left or Right, it’s Forward.  Let’s do the job that history has left for us.</p>
<p>Do something that makes you uncomfortable today.  It is part of the process.  And be sure to <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">come to a rally if we&#8217;re hosting one near you</a>.</p>
<p>Energized by you all,</p>
<p><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/473/attachments/original/andrewyangsignature.jpg?1556797720" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="136" height="75" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello and thank you for the support!</p>
<p>We just got back from 4 days in Iowa.  As you know, Iowa is the first state to vote and will be crucial in 2020.</p>
<p>I have been visiting Iowa since last summer, when I spoke at the <a title="Andrew Yang at the Iowa Wing Ding" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkH0xGUgR0c">Wing Ding</a>.  I have returned every month since.</p>
<p>This time was different.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Town Hall in Iowa" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/453/attachments/original/IMG_3343.jpg?1556634655" alt="An auditorium filled with Iowans listening to Andrew Yang describe his vision for the future of America" width="100%" /></p>
<p>We drew a crowd of hundreds to a Town Hall in Des Moines with JD Scholten, a political icon in Iowa who is fighting for the working class.  People drove from hours away to attend.  The crowd included people wearing <a title="Buy a MATH hat" href="https://shop.yang2020.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/math-hat">MATH hats</a> and people who were simply curious.</p>
<p>Among the things I heard from excited Iowans:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“My son told me I had to come see you.  He’s already decided to caucus for you.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I read your book and have been giving it to everyone I know.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You converted me.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You will be the first person I ever caucus for.”</em></p>
<p>Folks then waited for up to an hour afterwards for selfies and to meet.  That wasn’t happening in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Meets with Supporters in Iowa" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/453/attachments/original/IMG_3344.jpg?1556634738" alt="Andrew Yang high fives a supporter after his Iowa Town Hall" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I also spoke at the Democracy Ball in Boone County, a rural forum in Stuart, and several other events.  Everywhere we went there was a ton of energy and interest in the campaign.  It felt very much like we had turned a corner.</p>
<p>We weren’t alone—journalists from the Washington Post and Politico were with us tracking the campaign. That wasn’t happening in 2018 either. We will compete in Iowa as our campaign gains traction.  I made appearances on CNN and <a title="Where Andrew Yang stands on 2020 issues" href="https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/where-andrew-yang-stands-on-2020-issues-1511459907882">MSNBC</a> from Des Moines.</p>
<p>We are growing all of the time.  But we need your help.  Though our April fundraising is ahead of our Q1 pace of $1.7 million, it is not growing fast enough.  We will have to demonstrate major growth in order to contend in the days ahead.  If you have the ability to do so, <a title="Andrew Yang's ActBlue Donation Page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang">please do make a donation today</a>.  This is particularly important if you haven’t donated, as we are trying to reach 200,000 donors by the debates in June.  You can also <a title="Yang2020 Store" href="https://shop.yang2020.com/">buy some swag</a>—we are told that people shout “Yang Gang!” at you on the street if they spot a fellow supporter.</p>
<p>Your donation will pay off.  We are already polling at 3% in <a title="Emerson Polling for Texas" href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/2020-texas-biden-and-beto-in-dead-heat-in-democratic-primary">Texas</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/436641-biden-sanders-top-2020-democratic-field-in-nevada-poll">Nevada</a>, and the New York Times recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/29/us/politics/democratic-primary-debates-2020.html">noted</a> that we are one of only 8 candidates to qualify for the debates via both polling and donations.  We are drawing crowds of hundreds or even thousands to our <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First rallies</a> around the country.  This week we will be in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Seattle" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-seattle-wa-tickets-59624294871">Seattle</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Detroit" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-detroit-michigan-tickets-60845631923">Detroit</a>, and <a title="Minneapolis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-minneapolis-mn-tickets-59674699633">Minneapolis</a> before heading to <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour in Portsmouth" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-portsmouth-nh-tickets-61004410835">New Hampshire</a> and our biggest rally yet in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour in NYC" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">New York City</a>.</p>
<p>We can change the course of our nation’s history.  But we will have to dig deep—and demonstrate ourselves that people matter more than money.  Americans are hungry for this message.  I see it every day.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I appreciate your donations because they mean that we can demonstrate our grassroots support, and I can focus on growing our base instead of doing the money chase.  It is incredibly empowering.  You all make me stronger.</p>
<p>Let’s show what we can do.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for the support—we really appreciate it!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I landed in Las Vegas on Tuesday for our first campaign trip in Nevada.  We met with local activists and hosted a town hall with 500 Nevadans:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang at the Nevada Humanity First Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/439/attachments/original/Image_from_iOS.jpg?1556285764" alt="Andrew Yang addresses a large crowd at a rally in Nevada" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our visit to Nevada was preceded by reality on the ground.  It turns out that <a title="Robots are stealing Nevada jobs more than any other state" href="https://mynews4.com/news/local/robots-stealing-nevada-jobs-more-than-any-other-state">Nevada is the #1 state</a> out of all fifty states in terms of the proportion of jobs that are subject to automation.  <a title="Future job automation to hit hardest in low wage metropolitan areas like Las Vegas, Orlando and Riverside-San Bernardino" href="https://www.iseapublish.com/index.php/2017/05/03/future-job-automation-to-hit-hardest-in-low-wage-metropolitan-areas-like-las-vegas-orlando-and-riverside-san-bernardino/">One study said</a> that 3 out of 5 of the jobs in retail, gaming, and hospitality are in danger.  The Nevada economy revolves around those industries, followed closely by administrative/call-center work and transportation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is happening right now.  <a title="MGM Resorts to Replace Bartenders With Machines (No, Really)" href="https://vitalvegas.com/mgm-resorts-to-replace-bartenders-with-machines-no-really/">MGM recently announced</a> that it will replace its bartenders with robots later this year and gave all of its current bartenders notice that they would be losing their jobs.  I know this may sound like a joke or science fiction—but it is all too real to the families impacted.  Bartending is how many Nevadans make ends meet.  The children of various hospitality workers put together a <a title="WHO'S NEXT? (Children of workers subject to automation)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDWwiWV7TOc&amp;feature=youtu.be"><u>video</u></a> to call attention to what this means to them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">MGM is a very smart company and has tested the robot bartenders in other locations.  It turns out that customers don’t mind them.  Some even like them.  How long before other gaming companies follow their lead?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When I met with local labor leaders, they were acutely aware of the danger.  Protests have already broken out to try and shield their workers from technological changes.  But union leaders know that change is in the air, and most of those changes will not be good for the workers they represent.  There is a sense of searching for a solution.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In part due to our campaign’s reckoning with the reality of automation, we had a very welcome audience throughout Las Vegas.  Nevada is the 3<sup>rd </sup>state to vote and will set the tone in 2020.  We made some friends in Reno and will be spending more time in the state.  As part of the <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First Tour</a>, I met with an artist who is packing UPS trucks to make ends meet and a counselor who is heading back to school to get a nursing degree.  I learned a lot from each of them.  I also met with a non-profit that is working on converting shipping containers to affordable housing; apparently, it costs about $35,000 to turn a shipping container into a comfortable-looking apartment for one complete with bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.  There is a lot of potential there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are <a title="Nevada 2020: Biden and Sanders lead Democratic primary field; Trump Looks to Flip the Silver State Red" href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/nevada-2020-biden-and-sanders-lead-democratic-primary-field-trump-looks-to-flip-the-silver-state-red">polling at 3% in Nevada</a>—and that percentage is set to grow.  Several people came up to me and said that they were switching their party affiliation so they could caucus for me.  Our message is very powerful and getting stronger all of the time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend, I am in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour in Des Moines" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-hall-with-andrew-yang-jd-scholten-in-des-moines-iowa-tickets-59745891570">Iowa</a>, and then next week we will be holding rallies in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Seattle" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-seattle-wa-tickets-59624294871">Seattle</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Detroit" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-detroit-michigan-tickets-60845631923">Detroit</a>, and <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Minneapolis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-minneapolis-mn-tickets-59674699633">Minneapolis</a>. Then, we are back to <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in NYC" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">New York</a> for what should be our biggest rally yet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The people in Nevada know what is going on around them—they are the new ground zero for the automation of jobs.  $1,000 a month would be a game-changer for the families there and around the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s win in 2020 and get the Freedom Dividend to them as soon as possible.  We don’t have that much time.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello, I hope you are doing great!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am writing this from LA, where we met with local community leaders and then proceeded to have one of our biggest rallies yet.  2,000+ people came out to celebrate our message, and we made <a title="Sen. Cory Booker, Andrew Yang Celebrate Earth Day" href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Sen_-Corey-Booker_-Andrew-Yang-Celebrate-Earth-Day_Los-Angeles-508924042.html">the local LA news</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang at LA Humanity First Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/421/attachments/original/Image_from_iOS.jpg?1556035651" alt="Andrew Yang addresses a huge crown in LA" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;">It was a blast.  The <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First Tour</a> has been a ton of fun. The best thing about our events is the energy and optimism of the people who show up.  Plus our playlist gets better all of the time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><img title="Andrew Yang Addresses the Crowd" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/421/attachments/original/Image_from_iOS_%281%29.jpg?1556035698" alt="Andrew Yang talks about his policy platform in front of a crown in LA" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The press continues to roll in—<a title="Who Might Make The Democratic Debate Stage?" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-might-make-the-democratic-debate-stage/">538 noted</a> that I am one of only 6 candidates to meet both the polling AND donation requirements to make the DNC debates (the others are Buttigieg, Sanders, O&#8217;Rourke, Harris, and Warren).  Thank you for making it happen.  <a title="Andrew Yang, Marianne Williamson, Bernie Sanders are the 2020 candidates standing out to our readers" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/04/21/yang-williamson-sanders-2020-candidates-standing-out/3506638002/">USA Today had me at #1</a> from their readers in terms of candidates they were excited about.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week we are <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour Rally in Las Vegas" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-las-vegas-nv-tickets-59674859110">heading to Nevada</a>, which is the 3<sup>rd </sup>state to vote for the Democratic nominee.  For those of you who aren’t super into politics (which may describe about 90% of you), the order of states voting goes (dates subject to change):</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa – February 3rd, 2020</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">New Hampshire – February 11th, 2020</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Nevada – February 22nd, 2020</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina – February 29th, 2020</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">California, Texas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Democrats Abroad* – March 3rd, 2020.</li>
</ol>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is why you always hear about voters in Iowa and New Hampshire in particular—because they vote first, they have an enormous amount of influence.  Historically, you need to finish at the top of the heap in one or both of those states to win the nomination.  This is in part because the results in early states drive voters in later states—if you do well in the early states, you get much more support, money, and attention every day.  By the time the calendar gets to March, the nomination is often down to 1 or 2 candidates.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This time, that may hold true again.  But there is some thought that the nomination calendar will stretch through the Spring and Summer in 2020 because the field is so fragmented that it will be hard for any one candidate to achieve a majority.  This is particularly true given that superdelegates—who went en masse for Hillary Clinton last time—cannot vote until the 2nd<sup> </sup>round of voting at the Democratic convention in Milwaukee in July, a change they made to give more power to grassroots voters.  Some believe that there will be a contested convention where no one has a majority and there will be a big negotiation to determine the nominee.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to know—a field this big on the Democratic side is unprecedented.  We are in uncharted territory.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s one reason the opportunity for us is so historic.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One thing to note about the scenario above—if we get a significant number of delegates, we could be in position to ride into Milwaukee in position to decide the Democratic nominee.  Universal Basic Income, updated economic measurements, and a more modern approach to AI as part of the Democratic Party platform?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sounds good to me.  It’s very achievable.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To get there, we need to win support everywhere, but particularly in the early states.  I am excited to campaign in Nevada—<a title="Emerson Polling in Nevada" href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/nevada-2020-biden-and-sanders-lead-democratic-primary-field-trump-looks-to-flip-the-silver-state-red">where we already are at 3% support</a>—<a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">this week and Iowa later this week</a>.  This will be my 11th<sup> </sup>trip to Iowa and we now have many friends there.  I believe that we will outperform any polling in the early states in part because we are attracting folks who will be voting for the first time in a Democratic caucus or primary.  But we still have a lot of work to do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The goal is to win.  We can do it.  History is providing us a golden opportunity.  Let’s make the most of it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The next four stops in the <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First Tour</a> are <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Las Vegas" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-las-vegas-nv-tickets-59674859110">Las Vegas</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Des Moines" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-hall-with-andrew-yang-jd-scholten-in-des-moines-iowa-tickets-59745891570">Des Moines</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Seattle" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-seattle-wa-tickets-59624294871">Seattle</a>, and <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Minneapolis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-minneapolis-mn-tickets-59674699633">Minneapolis</a>, and then back to <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Washington Square Park" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">New York for a big rally in Washington Square Park</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our crowds get bigger all of the time.  With you behind us we will make history in 2020.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for your support!  It means everything to us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our latest rally was Thursday night in Atlanta—more than 1,000 amazing people came out.  We made many new friends; the <a title="Schedule of Rallies on the Humanity First Tour" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First Tour</a> is a blast and getting bigger and better as we grow.  The rally was <a title="Democrat Yang brings presidential campaign to Atlanta" href="https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/democrat-yang-brings-presidential-campaign-atlanta/26pbS3Grfm5SrMys4yrF9O/">covered in the Atlanta Journal Constitution</a> the next day.</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One benefit of the Tour is all of the press we have been getting at each stop.  A couple people have run analyses of the number of press mentions and articles about different presidential candidates.  Perhaps not surprisingly, I am in last place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><a title="Which Democratic Candidate Gets the Most News Coverage?" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/which-democratic-candidate-gets-the-most-news-coverage-aa4312fb53db?fbclid=IwAR0e8asGwHA4wfKEhpj_3CA3G8sD2SBl9lvj-f_kESFYpun1ielQd1AEcu8"><img title="Media Coverage by Candidate" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/404/attachments/original/1_ybnJ0qrBorqnwV_CCcFOzg.png?1555767391" alt="A graph of all the media coverage of each presidential candidate" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">What you might not realize is this is a GREAT sign for the campaign.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="Emerson College Polling in Democratic Primary Field" href="http://emersonpolling.com/2019/04/15/april-national-poll-bernie-takes-lead-for-democratic-nomination-mayor-pete-on-the-move/">We are polling at 3% nationally</a> despite most people never having heard of me.  If we are drawing that support despite low name recognition and little press, that means that as more people find out about us we will do better and better.  Indeed, one person ran an analysis on the polling-to-article ratio, and I am well ahead of the field.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="&quot;Pound-for-Pound&quot; Polling Performance" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/404/attachments/original/corej6lbe8t21.jpg?1555767496" alt="An analysis of the polling performance of Andrew vs. the news coverage, compared to other candidates" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This speaks to the power of our campaign.  Many of you have been drawn to this campaign by <a title="Andrew Yang's policies page" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/">our specific policies and ideas</a>.  We pride ourselves on having a clear vision that we have laid out for the world to see. Of course there is <a title="Police page for the Freedom Dividend" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/the-freedom-dividend/">the Freedom Dividend</a> and <a title="Policy page for Human-Centered Capitalism" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/">Human-Centered Capitalism</a>, but there are also <a title="Policy page for banning robo-calls" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/robo-calling-text-line/">banning robocalls</a>, <a title="Policy page for a White House psychologist" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/white-house-psychologist/">a psychologist in the White House</a>, <a title="Policy page for paying NCAA athletes" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/ncaa-pay-athletes/">paying NCAA athletes</a>, <a title="Policy page for legalizing marijuana" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/legalization-of-marijuana/">legalizing marijuana</a>, <a title="Policy page for improving student loans" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/student-loan-debt/">improving student loans</a> and <a title="Policy page for making community college affordable" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/close-skills-gap-community-college/">college</a> <a title="Policy page for controlling the cost of higher education" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/controlling-cost-higher-education/">affordability</a>, <a title="Policy page for a carbon fee and dividend" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/carbon-fee-dividend/">a carbon tax</a> and <a title="Andrew Yang's policy page" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/">many others</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We have been putting out new policies for the past several weeks.  If you haven’t been to <a title="Andrew Yang's Policies Page" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/">our policy page</a> in a while you’re sure to find something new.  Our ideas are strong enough to sweep the nation if more people find out about them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is where we need your help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many of you have been spreading the word—thank you for that.  This weekend, please do send your favorite interview or write-up or policy to your friends.  Some of the most commonly shared pieces on the campaign are:</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The more you share our vision for the country the stronger it will become.  The way this campaign wins is if we become a movement.  And that can only happen with your help.  We recently passed 100,000 donors and are excited to get to 200,000 by the summer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you again for your support.  This week, the <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First Tour</a> goes to <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Los Angeles" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-los-angeles-ca-tickets-59624282835">Los Angeles</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Las Vegas" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-las-vegas-nv-tickets-59674859110">Nevada</a>, and <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Des Moines" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-hall-with-andrew-yang-jd-scholten-in-des-moines-iowa-tickets-59745891570">Des Moines</a>—would love to see you and your friends there!  Our rallies and events are a lot of fun.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The right ideas and the right people can change the world. Let’s prove it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Have a great holiday weekend.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been an amazing few days.  Rave reviews continue to come in from our <a title="CNN Town Hall Updates" href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/marianne-williamson-town-hall/index.html">CNN Town Hall on Sunday</a>—I’ve been described as “the most human,” “knowledgeable,” “likeable,” and “presidential” in various outlets.  Our website traffic has spiked, press asks have been streaming in, and we’ve raised over $250k in <a title="Andrew Yang ActBlue Page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?">donations</a> and <a title="Andrew Yang Swag Store" href="https://shop.yang2020.com/">swag sales</a> since Sunday.  Thank you so much for making it happen!</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In other enormous news, <a title="Emerson Poll" href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/april-national-poll-bernie-takes-lead-for-democratic-nomination-mayor-pete-on-the-move">an Emerson national poll</a> came out on Monday that had me at 3% nationally.  Think about that for a second—3% of Americans said that I was their top choice for President of the United States.  This was taken BEFORE the Town Hall.  To go from unknown to 3% national support is phenomenal.  The Emerson poll is one of the polls that the DNC uses to determine candidate support.  We will only grow from here.  We can contend and win the whole thing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the Town Hall, I did a <a title="Andrew Yang on PBS NewsHour" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/andrew-yang-on-how-the-u-s-can-adapt-to-its-new-economic-realities">televised interview with PBS</a> as well as interviews with <a title="Andrew Yang on NPR" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/16/714090176/2020-opening-arguments-andrew-yang-john-delaney-jay-inslee">NPR</a>, Bloomberg, and Politico.  And then we had one of our biggest rallies yet on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Almost 2,000 supporters were there and the rally was covered in <a title="C-SPAN Coverage of DC Humanity First Rally" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?459819-1/democratic-presidential-candidate-andrew-yang-holds-rally-lincoln-memorial">C-SPAN</a>, <a title="Business Insider: Andrew Yang's DC Rally" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-youthful-diverse-crowd-lincoln-memorial-2019-4">Business Insider</a>, Fox, and other press outlets.  It was a blast.  This campaign is quickly becoming the movement that we need.  If you attend a rally you will see what I mean.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, I am doing national press, and today I&#8217;m heading to <a title="Andrew Yang Humanity First Atlanta Rally" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-atlanta-ga-tickets-59624264781">Atlanta for our next Humanity First Rally</a>.  Over 2,000 people have RSVPed and it should be dynamite.  On Monday, we are having <a title="Andrew Yang Humanity First Rally in LA" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-los-angeles-ca-tickets-59624282835">another big rally in Los Angeles</a>.  (<a title="Full Schedule for the Humanity First Tour" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Full Schedule</a>)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are getting stronger all of the time.  I am too.  It feels great.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are still in the midst of a fundraising drive—<a title="Andrew Yang ActBlue Page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=20">please do donate $20 today if you can</a>.  We are neck-and-neck with Bernie in terms of grassroots support (81% vs. 84% small contributions of &lt;$200) and want to be the most people-powered campaign in the field.  Your support will make us better able to fight and grow.  Thank you for believing in us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An <a title="Everyone's Talking About Basic Income. Here Are 8 Problems It Could Fix" href="http://time.com/5571472/basic-income-society-problems/?xid=tcoshare#0e3bc275-fd0c-4675-9a34-1d012af032c3?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=social-share-article">article came out in TIME Magazine</a> that argued Universal Basic Income could help solve 8 of our biggest problems: Inequality, Economic Insecurity, Debt, Stress, Precarity, Robots, Extinction, and Populism.  I don’t know about that last one, but the rest is dead on.  The problems are rising and we need real solutions.  The world is coming our way.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">3% of Americans want me as President—and most have still never heard of me.  The more they hear about me, the stronger we will get.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s get it.</p>
