								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the campaign launched in February, the <em>New York Times</em> called Andrew a “longer than longshot” candidate.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve had some real wins. Nearly every major news outlet has profiled Andrew. Donors and supporters from all over the country – South Carolina, North Dakota, Minnesota, and just about every other state – have stepped forward and said, “This is our campaign.”</p>
<p>Still, even our biggest supporters ask us: “Does Andrew really have a shot?”</p>
<p>We understand their disbelief. Andrew’s platform is bold, smart, and entirely new. This kind of political change never comes easy—and many are so jaded by American politics that it’s hard to believe meaningful progress is possible.</p>
<p>Here at HQ, we know we’re in for the fight of our lives. Andrew is going up against establishment politicians with multi-million dollar warchests. We can’t outraise the competition.</p>
<p>Our legitimacy is not going to come from fancy endorsements or press hits. It’s going to come from you.</p>
<p>So today, we’re asking you to give us one dollar.</p>
<p>It’s not about the money—it’s about what it demonstrates. It’s about showing the establishment that Andrew’s “radical” solutions aren’t so radical, and that thousands of voters across the country believe his ideas belong on the debate stage.</p>
<p><strong>We need 100,000 people to donate just $1 each to Yang2020 by the end of the year.</strong> If we pull this off, we’ll have the attention we need to contend in the primaries and change America’s political dialogue. Most importantly, Andrew’s vision won’t seem like such a longshot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>You can help us make this real.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a class="butnMed lightBlue" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/one-for-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Please donate $1 and join One for Humanity today</strong></a></p>
<p>Does Andrew really have a shot?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re one of the millions of Americans fed up with seeing Trump in the oval office, or you’re one of the silent masses eagerly awaiting Trump’s next political upset, we’ve all got one question right now: Who is running for President in 2020?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky for you, we are political nerds and did all the digging to bring you this extensive list of likely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contenders running for president in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>POLLING TOP 5 RIGHT NOW:</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1819 size-medium" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/1.-Biden-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/1.-Biden-236x300.jpg 236w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/1.-Biden.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></p>
<h4><b>1. Joe Biden</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden is a former Vice President of the United States, serving under Barack Obama for eight years. He has been outspoken about climate change and is a vocal critic of president Donald Trump. He is originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania but served as democratic senator of Delaware from 1973-2009. As of October 2018, Joe Biden leads at 33% in democratic polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden is seen as a champion of working-class people, fighting for middle-class tax cuts. He will likely have the endorsement and star power of Barack Obama working in his favor, should he run. In addition, there are a number of viral online </span><a href="https://theweek.com/articles/468552/6-best-onion-parodies-joe-biden"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by the satirical news outlet The Onion, portraying an alternate ‘Dynamite Joe’ Biden as a burnout slacker who drinks excessively and gets away with crimes. These are wildly popular with millennials and have worked to make him more appealing with this demographic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1820" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2.-Bernie-237x300.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2.-Bernie-237x300.jpg 237w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2.-Bernie.jpg 404w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></p>
<h4><b>2. Bernie Sanders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernie Sanders is a senator from Vermont and a self-proclaimed democratic socialist. He ran for president in 2016 but lost his party’s nomination to Hillary Clinton. Sanders has</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">already visited the early primary states and has been measured by the 538 political outlet as the most likely person to run for office in 2020. He is currently polling at 13%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernie’s platform includes Medicare for all and free college tuition, which makes him a favorite among millennial voters. He is seen as a stable, believable candidate since he’s been saying the same thing for years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1821" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<h4><b>3. Elizabeth Warren</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. She is a legal scholar and former economist who has proposed several ideas to fix capitalism in her recent book “This Fight Is Our Fight.” She worked in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and was a vocal proponent of breaking up ‘too big to fail’ banks after the financial crisis of 2008. She is also an outspoken critic of president Donald Trump. She is currently polling around 8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren will likely have some momentum following her ‘she persisted’ speech, which went viral in 2017. She could potentially capture some of the momentum from Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run if she embraces similar policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1822" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Booker-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Booker-245x300.jpg 245w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Booker.jpg 675w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></p>
<h4><b>4. Cory Booker</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cory Booker is the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey and currently holds a Senate seat representing New Jersey. He has laid out a vision to revive schools in Newark and has also worked to drastically reduce violence in the city. Booker has visited several of the 2020 early primary states and polls in the top 5 Democratic candidates for president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Booker is considered by many to be an inspiring speaker who understands how to use social media and build momentum with young people. Even though Booker is a progressive, he has proven to be willing to reach across the aisle and has worked with conservative Republicans to draft marijuana decriminalization legislation.  </span></p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1823" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-218x300.jpg 218w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-768x1056.jpg 768w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-745x1024.jpg 745w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px" /></span><b></b></h4>
<h4><b>5. Kamala Harris</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kamala Harris is a former prosecutor and attorney general for the state of California. She was an outspoken ‘no’ on Kavanaugh and is passionate about equal pay for women. She has also been outspoken about the need to protect children at the US border. She is currently polling around 9% or third place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris is a first-term senator and the new Starchild of the Democratic party. She is also a #MeToo champion and will most likely garner support from women &#8211; particularly women of color &#8211; should she decide to run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>SECOND TIER CONTENDERS:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these possible 2020 presidential candidates will make you go, “Who?” There are many PROS here, but their relative anonymity is the major CON they all share.</span></p>

Yang is running on a platform of Universal Basic Income &#8211; giving every American adult $1,000 per month as a way to immediately reduce poverty and respond to automation displacing jobs. He has a total of <a href="http://www.yang2020.com/policies">73 policy positions listed on his </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the most of any candidate in the field. Many have said that “the opposite of Donald Trump: an Asian man who likes math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Yang is actually a bit more well-known than many of the Second Tier candidates listed above, and his ground game in Iowa and New Hampshire has been particularly strong. He has spoken at several Silicon Valley tech companies, including Google, and was recently interviewed on the </span><a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/130-universal-basic-income/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Harris podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.
