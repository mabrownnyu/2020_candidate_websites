								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Exciting news—just this morning, CNN released their latest rankings for the 2020 Democratic presidential field. Out of 24 candidates, only 10 get placed in the ranking.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cnnrankings">For the first time, they placed Andrew in the Top 10.</a> </strong>That places us far ahead of sitting senators, governors, members of Congress, and former Cabinet members. We are gaining serious momentum—and the media is finally starting to catch on.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cnnrankings"><img title="CNN Presidential Power Rankings" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/606/attachments/original/CNN-Power-Ranking.png?1558627884" alt="Andrew Yang shows up on the CNN Power Rankings list for the first time" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cnnrankings"><strong>But to win, we need to jump at the chance to build on this early attention. That means we need to hit our $3.5 million fundraising goal by the June 30th reporting deadline. Please click here to donate $20 today.</strong></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">$3.5 million is DOUBLE what we raised last quarter. If we succeed in hitting that goal, we will be the insurgent candidate that all the press is talking about. We will climb in the rankings. We will rise in the polls. And we will have the war chest we need to seriously compete for the Democratic nomination.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cnnrankings">Contribute $20 today and let&#8217;s keep the momentum growing.</a></strong></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Text from Andrew&#8217;s Speech:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Hello everyone.  It’s a privilege and an honor to be back here at Phillips Exeter.  This place shaped me in fundamental ways.  I learned so much here.  I can honestly say I would never be running for President if not for my time at Exeter. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>That said, I didn’t really enjoy my time here.  This is my first time back in 27 years.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Most of that was on me.  I arrived here as an Upper and you all know that’s a difficult transition.  I didn’t really fit in.  There was, however, something here that may still be true today.  This place was very competitive.  And we somehow knew things about each other that we&#8217;re going to determine where we went to school. “This kid has quadruple legacy to Harvard.  That guy’s family literally built Brown University. That guy has a set of restaurant guides named after his family.  That guy was going to get an athletic scholarship to Yale.”  The subtext was always that our value and stature was going to be determined by where we got into college.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I did well here.  I got into Stanford and Brown and decided to go to Brown. That too was a minor source of controversy.  People here were like, “Stanford is better than Brown.  Why would you go to Brown?”  I visited Stanford and thought it was too nice a place to go to school. Their acceptance brochure had been a picture of a football crowd saying “Yes Stanford!” and I didn’t like football. But I mainly went to Brown because my brother was going to school nearby at Wesleyan.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Brown allowed me to grow up. I felt things very strongly throughout my adolescence, probably one reason I didn’t enjoy it here.  I had a serious college relationship that, when it ended I took it hard.  But it helped me mature.  I was pretty depressed and Brown let me get away with that.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>After Brown, I still didn’t know what to do.  So I went to law school.  I spent 5 months as an unhappy lawyer at Davis Polk.  And I said, this is a terrible job.  My quote at the time was, “This firm is like a temple to the squandering of human potential.”  So I quit and started a dot-com.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I’m now thought of as a successful entrepreneur.  Some of you read my book ‘Smart People Should Build Things.’  And I’m going to share the secret to entrepreneurship:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Tell everyone you know that you’re going to do something.   That way, you don’t have a choice but to do it.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I started Stargiving.com, but it unfortunately flopped.  Everyone I knew was aware that I had failed.  That hurt too.  I worked at another startup that ran out of money and then a healthcare software company. I spent my twenties working at startups that didn’t work out.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Meanwhile, most of my friends at Exeter were bankers, consultants, and lawyers living in very nice apartments in Manhattan.  I was living with a roommate, teaching classes and throwing parties on the side. It was hard to stay positive.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>During this time, a friend from Exeter, Fiona Smith, called me up and asked me if I would meet with a friend of hers.  That meeting changed my life.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Her friend, Zeke had started an education company, Manhattan Prep, and asked if I could help.  I later became CEO of that company when I was 31 and Zeke stepped away.  The company eventually became number one in the country and was acquired by the Washington Post in 2009.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This is one reason why I know that Exeter shaped my career.  If Fiona hadn’t introduced me to Zeke, I never would have wound up running that company. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I was still haunted by the sense that we had so many of our talented people doing one of six things in six places:  finance, consulting, tech, law, medicine or academia in New York, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, DC or LA.  This was true of most of my friends at Exeter.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Now, you can’t be negative about something without offering a solution.  I thought about what I believed more people like you should be doing 5 or 6 years from now.  And I thought you should be starting businesses in places that need it – places like Detroit, New Orleans, Baltimore, or Birmingham.  We needed to create a path for people to do that.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>So I quit my job and started Venture for America.  I donated $120k and started calling rich friends and asked them, “Do you love America.”  Classmates from Exeter helped.  Another Exonian introduced me to a Foundation that became one of our first funders.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>This place is a magical, wonderful, difficult place to come of age.  You are around people constantly, yet it is easy to feel alone.  You are among the most successful high school students in the country, yet you feel your success to be challenged at all times. You are taught to do good in the world, yet it is your own success that remains the way that you are judged.  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>In my experience, if you want a career you will be proud of, you are going to have to fight for it.  The market will not help you.  Instead, the market will drive you to do certain things that may or may not be what you&#8217;d imagined.  And here in America in 2019, the market is the most powerful force in our society.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Venture for America has a credo, that I hope some of you find useful.  I confess that this place very much influenced it.  It is:  </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;My career is a choice that indicates my values. There is no courage without risk. I believe that actions are the proper measure of one’s accomplishments. I will create value for myself and others. I will act with integrity in all things.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Thank you, students of Phillips Exeter.  You will shape the future of this country.  Use your power wisely.  </em></p>

<p><strong>About Andrew</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most exciting and unique candidates to enter the 2020 US Presidential Race, Andrew Yang is a New York and Silicon Valley entrepreneur running as a Democrat. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, he founded Venture for America, a national public service fellowship that places recent grads in struggling communities to help local businesses revitalize the economy. Over 6 years running the organization, Andrew helped to create more than 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. His work at VFA saw him recognized by the Obama White House as a 2012 Champion of Change and a 2015 Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Andrew realized that artificial intelligence and other automation technologies threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs and current politicians weren’t even recognizing the problem, he knew the nation needed a leader with a vision on how to enter this radically different future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew’s innovative platform focuses on solutions to problems being faced by normal Americans, including the implementation of the Freedom Dividend: $1,000 a month for American adults, no strings attached. See his features in the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/andrew-yang-wants-to-run-for-president-promising-free-cash-handouts.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CNBC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/andrew-yang-2020-president-780803/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rolling Stone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra56e0HKAiU"><span style="font-weight: 400;">keynote speech</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Progress Iowa; his podcasts with </span><a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/andrew-yang/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freakonomics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/130-universal-basic-income/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">; and his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grciW239bp0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">campaign video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><strong>About The Freedom Dividend / Universal Basic Income</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Basic Income (UBI) guarantees a certain minimum income to every citizen within a given governed population, without having to pass a test or fulfill a work requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend is a universal basic income set at $1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, for all U.S. citizens over the age of 18, paid for by a new tax on automation. Yes, that means you and everyone you know would get another $1,000/month every month from the U.S. government, no questions asked. You could use that money to pay down debt, start a business, go back to school, or shop at local boutiques.

<p><em>From the Quad Cities to Sioux City, Andrew Yang will make the case for the Freedom Dividend and a Human-Centered Economy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Iowa; January 23, 2019: </strong>One of the first Democratic candidates to declare his 2020 campaign for president, Andrew Yang has been traversing the country and building a grassroots support network with an average donation of $11.</p>
<p>On his eighth trip to the Hawkeye State, as part of a six-state tour, Yang will have over a dozen town halls and events across 10 counties, including several on college campuses such as Simpson College, Central College, and Des Moines Area Community College. He will then join the College Democrats of America (CDA) to speak to over 200 student activists at the CDA Winter Convention on February 3rd at North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>Andrew will also personally give a resident in Iowa the Freedom Dividend in 2019, which will be announced later this year.</p>
<p>All of this is in service of promoting the Humanity First platform, policies designed to address the greatest economic and technological shift in our history. The three central tenets are:</p>

<p><strong>About Andrew</strong></p>
<p>One of the most exciting and unique candidates to enter the 2020 US Presidential Race, Andrew Yang is a New York and Silicon Valley entrepreneur running as a Democrat.</p>
<p>In 2011, he founded Venture for America, a national public service fellowship that places recent grads in struggling communities to help local businesses revitalize the economy. Over 6 years running the organization, Andrew helped to create more than 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. His work at VFA saw him recognized by the Obama White House as a 2012 Champion of Change and a 2015 Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>When Andrew realized that artificial intelligence and other automation technologies threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs and current politicians weren’t even recognizing the problem, he knew the nation needed a leader with a vision on how to enter this radically different future.</p>

<p><strong>About The Freedom Dividend / Universal Basic Income</strong></p>
<p>Universal Basic Income (UBI) guarantees a certain minimum income to every citizen within a given governed population, without having to pass a test or fulfill a work requirement.</p>
<p>Andrew Yang’s Freedom Dividend is a universal basic income set at $1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, for all U.S. citizens over the age of 18, paid for by a new tax on automation. Yes, that means you and everyone you know would get another $1,000/month every month from the U.S. government, no questions asked. You could use that money to pay down debt, start a business, go back to school, or shop at local boutiques.

<p><b>New York, New York, October 17, 2018: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang brings his message nationwide this November, speaking with working-class Americans at rallies in seven different cities across the country. This </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First Tour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will present his unique vision for the future of America and its economy directly to Americans, many who live in districts won by Donald Trump in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First Tour</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> will kick off on November 8th in Detroit. Once a highlight of the American manufacturing machine, Detroit lost many middle-class jobs as they were replaced by industrial robots, and the city’s population plummeted from a peak of 1.8 million to slightly under 700,000. The city’s perseverance in the face of struggle highlights both the necessity of the Freedom Dividend and what Americans can do when our government invests in its people. The struggles faced by Detroit are a preview of what is to come, as the top five job categories (administrative/clerical work, food service/prep, retail, transportation, manufacturing) are on the cusp of being overtaken by automation. We need bold solutions to ensure that Americans can make it through this transition and prosper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this kick-off event, the Tour will continue on to Chicago (9th), New Hampshire (12th), Cleveland (13th), Pittsburgh (14th), and Baltimore (15th), before ending in Iowa City on November 16th. After headlining the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkH0xGUgR0c"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Iowa Wing Ding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in August, Andrew has returned to the Hawkeye State five times in 2018 to meet with democratic activists and support Democratic candidates in the midterms. The support base he’s built in the state will bring a large turnout for this capstone event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this tour, Andrew will talk about how to revitalize an economy that has left most Americans behind. The three central pillars of his solution are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Freedom Dividend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a $1000/month basic income provided to Americans aged 18-64, no strings attached; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/single-payer-healthcare/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicare for All</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, ending the fear of medical bankruptcy while removing one of the largest costs associated with starting a small business; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human-Centered Capitalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, changing the focus of our economic measurement from GDP to numbers that reflect the well-being of the average American.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has an additional 70 policy positions outlined on his </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Policy Page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including solutions to the </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/opioid-crisis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">opioid epidemic</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/student-loan-debt/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">student debt crisis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/zoning/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">housing/zoning problems</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in urban areas.</span></p>

<p><b>About Andrew</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most exciting candidates to enter the 2020 US Presidential Race, Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur and author running as a Democrat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, he founded Venture for America, a national public service fellowship that places recent grads in struggling communities to help local businesses revitalize the economy. Over 6 years running the organization, Andrew helped to create more than 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. His work at VFA saw him recognized by the Obama White House as a 2012 Champion of Change and a 2015 Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Andrew realized that artificial intelligence and other automation technologies threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs and current politicians weren’t even recognizing the problem, he knew the nation needed a leader with a vision on how to enter this radically different future. </span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>2020 Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang Visits High School in North Philadelphia to Discuss Entrepreneurship, Personal Finance, and Education</strong></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew visits the North Philadelphia school by invitation to address the student body, including those taking part in a unique entrepreneurship and financial literacy program</span></i></p>
<p><b>Philadelphia; October 5, 2018: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Presidential Candidate Andrew Yang (D) arrives in Philadelphia on Thursday, October 10th, to visit Olney Charter High School, located in one of the most underfunded school districts in the nation. Here, educator Dan LaSalle has created a unique program that empowers his students to learn personal finance and entrepreneurship. As part of the program, students receive a “salary” for creating and leading student groups that are run much like businesses. You can read more about it </span><a href="http://phillyschoolleaders.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/PSL_Profile_Dan_LaSalle_v61.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a serial entrepreneur, Andrew Yang recognizes the value in teaching young Americans the skills needed to start their own companies. He’s also a proponent of providing </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/financial-counseling/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">financial literacy education for all</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, starting in high school and continuing throughout life. The program at Olney Charter High School shows the power of investing money in our citizens so they can start businesses that are uniquely valuable to their communities. This program is similar to </span><a href="https://ventureforamerica.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Venture for America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the service organization started by Andrew Yang in 2011, where recent graduates were brought in to consult with businesses in struggling communities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew will talk with students about the power of having a mindset of abundance over one of scarcity and discuss two of the central policy platforms of his campaign: </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Freedom Dividend</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in which every American adult between the ages of 18 and 64 would be given $1,000 per month, and </span><a href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/human-capitalism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Human-Centered Capitalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which would change the focus of our economic measurements from GDP and the stock market to numbers that better reflect the well-being of average Americans. He’ll also discuss his education platform, and answer questions from the student body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew will be at the school on October 10, 2018 and available for interviews starting at 1:30pm. Please reach out if you would like to arrange an interview or cover this event.</span></p>

<p>America has a shortage of jobs. Many people are working extra hours for less. Big companies are pushing people into contract jobs paying their own expenses with no real employment.</p>

<p><strong>New York, NY, April 19, 2018:</strong> Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang is coming to Concord, NH on Wednesday, April 25th.

As President, he would enact the Freedom Dividend, giving $1,000 per month to every adult U.S. citizen between the ages 18 and 64.</p>
<p>Andrew believes so strongly in the Freedom Dividend improving the lives of millions of Americans that he plans to demonstrate its effectiveness immediately, starting in New Hampshire. <strong>Starting in 2019, he will personally give one New Hampshire resident $1,000 every month for the entire year. </strong>He and his team will select a recipient in December 2018 from nominations collected across the community, with plans to expand.</p>
<p>What does this mean to New Hampshire residents? Andrew Yang is coming to Concord on Wednesday, April 25<sup>th </sup>to meet with New Hampshire voters and explain his vision to put Humanity First.  Here is our public itinerary:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>2pm – 4pm                            Coffee &amp; Open Conversation at </em><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HJmVKvbi8hm"><em>True Brew Barista</em></a></p>

<p><strong>About Andrew</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Yang is an entrepreneur and author running for President as a Democrat in 2020. In 2011 he founded Venture for America, a national entrepreneurship fellowship, and spent the last 6 years helping to create more than 2,500 jobs in cities like Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh. His work at VFA had him recognized by the Obama White House as a 2012 Champion of Change and 2015 Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship. When Andrew realized that new technologies like artificial intelligence and automation threatened to eliminate one-third of all American jobs, he knew the nation needed a leader with a vision for our radically different future. Andrew’s highly innovative platform includes the implementation of a Universal Basic Income: $1,000 a month for every American adult age 18-64, no strings attached. See his features in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html">New York Times</a>, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/11/andrew-yang-wants-to-run-for-president-promising-free-cash-handouts.html">CNBC</a> and <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-presidential-platform-universal-basic-income-2018-4">Business Insider</a>, and watch his campaign video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhArPPmHjCs">here</a>. His book, ‘<a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414247">The War on Normal People</a>,’ details his concerns about the automation of labor and how we can build a better future for all Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About Universal Basic Income</strong></p>
<p>Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a form of social security that guarantees a certain amount of money to every citizen within a given governed population, without having to pass a test or fulfill a work requirement. Every Universal Basic Income plan can be different in terms of amount or design.</p>
<p>Andrew Yang is running for President as Democrat in 2020 on the platform of Universal Basic Income, which he calls the Freedom Dividend. The Freedom Dividend he is proposing for the United States is a set of guaranteed payments of $1,000 per month, or $12,000 per year, to all U.S. citizens between the ages of 18 and 64. Yes, that means you and everyone you know would get another $1,000/month every month from the U.S. government, no questions asked.
