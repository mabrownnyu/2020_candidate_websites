								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone, and Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend!  I hope that you have plans to enjoy a great holiday with friends and family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I remember when Dr. King’s Birthday first became a national holiday.  It was 1986.  I was in sixth grade.  We were amazed that there would be a new holiday.  We watched MLK’s <em>I Have a Dream</em> speech in class.  It made a deep impression on that darkened classroom of 12-year-olds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I watched the speech again in college in a U.S. History course 8 years later.  It struck me as even more profound then.  Martin Luther King Jr. may be the most powerful moral symbol in American history.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s something you might not know: Martin Luther King Jr. began advocating for a Universal Basic Income in the final year of his life.  Here&#8217;s a video of him speaking about it at Stanford in April, 1967:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><a title="MLK Jr's Speech on UBI (YouTube)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT2jpgSZSO0"><img title="MLK Jr. Speaking about UBI" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/119/attachments/original/mlk.gif?1547845756" alt="Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a speech on a universal basic income" width="230" height="230" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And here is a direct quote from his final book:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective – the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the</em> <em>guaranteed income.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">—Martin Luther King Jr., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?</span> (1967)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an <a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/mlk-on-guaranteed-income-bfd060fd5314">excerpt</a> from that book’s final chapter, most of which could be written today:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>We have [come a] long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people to idleness and bind them into constant or frequent unemployment against their will. The poor are less often dismissed from our conscience today by being branded as inferior and incompetent. We also never know that no matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands it does not eliminate all poverty. . . .We have so energetically mastered production that we now must give attention to distribution . . . </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are likely to find that the problems of housing and education, instead of [preceding] the elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter housing decay . . . Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands, when he has the assurance that his income is stable and certain, and when he knows that he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts between husband, wife and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth on a scale of dollars is eliminated . . . </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The proposal is not a “civil rights” program, in the sense that the term is currently used. The program would benefit all the poor, including the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white will act in coalition to affect this change, because their combined strength will be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our nation’s adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we realize that for nearly 40 years two groups in our society have already been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and poorest. The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule, through welfare benefits.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity, which has vanished, and to compress our abundant condensed into the overfed mouth of the middle and upper class until [they] gag with superfluity . . . </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">—Martin Luther King Jr. (1967)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was assassinated a few months later, in April, 1968.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our tendency today is, I believe, to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday as an example of a dream realized.  He fought for racial equality, and with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that ended public segregation and banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, America became more just and equitable.  We celebrate his legacy every January as an example of the moral development of our country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is another interpretation though – that he was in the midst of his work and that work was cut short and left unfinished.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. had clearly turned his attention to a guaranteed minimum income as the next major Civil Rights issue of his time.  Even with MLK’s passing, a guaranteed income became a mainstream goal.  Milton Friedman was for it and 1,200 economists signed a <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/90th%20Congress/Income%20Maintenance%20Programs%20Volume%20II%20(423).pdf">study</a> saying it would be great for both the economy and society.  A guaranteed national income even <a href="https://shift.newco.co/2016/08/30/when-basic-income-was-almost-an-american-reality/">passed</a> the House of Representatives four years later in 1971 under Richard Nixon.  Unfortunately, it stalled in the Senate and the moment was lost.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now, almost fifty years later, here we are, celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. How would he reflect on America in 2019?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">What would he want us to do – honor his memory, or further his work?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Basic Income helps those who have the least the most.  Women whose work is often unrecognized and uncompensated would have the freedom to improve their situations and/or walk away from abusive jobs or relationships.  Members of marginalized groups would have greater access to resources and paths forward.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I recently shared that a couple in Georgia, inspired by this campaign, is funding a Freedom Dividend of $12,000 for an individual or family in South Carolina later this year.  They reference Martin Luther King Jr.’s words in their pledge:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>People may wonder why ordinary citizens like us are willing to give up $12,000 to help virtual strangers. Our reason is simple. We are excited to be involved in a potential solution to one of our nation’s biggest problems: poverty. It puts the money back into the hands of one our nation’s biggest resources: our people, knowing that individuals, and not governments, know what is most needed to improve their life and their communities.  As Christians, we strongly believe in the idea of charitable giving. As people who fiercely believe in democracy, we understand that what Martin Luther King Jr. said was true: “If democracy is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this (economic) inequity. It is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading human life by clinging to archaic thinking.”</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s truly celebrate Martin Luther King’s birthday the way he would want.  Let’s finish his work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yours,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">December 31<sup>st </sup>is a crucial reporting deadline for the campaign.  We want to report a growing number of supporters each period – right now we are close but not quite there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="Andrew Yang ActBlue page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang">Please do make a contribution today</a> and let the establishment know that this campaign has the people on its side.  Every bit helps – particularly if you are a new donor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is an invigorating thing to send an email to thousands of people and then actually have them take action in response.  Anytime you act it revs up both me and the team.  We remember when this campaign was getting started and our list was literally zero.  Now, our supporter base is in the tens of thousands and growing every day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And we are just getting started.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please make a donation by December 31<sup>st </sup>so you can be on the record.  And if you are near New York City for New Year’s Eve, <a title="EventBrite link for NYE Part" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yangs-new-years-eve-bash-tickets-53183646719">we are having a party, and we’d love for you to join us</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s to ending 2018 on a high note – and then making history in 2019.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/106/attachments/original/signature-blue.jpg?1546020620" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="137" height="75" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and Happy Holidays to you and yours!  I hope you are enjoying a wonderful time with your family and loved ones.  I am writing this on the way to Florida where I am visiting my in-laws with my family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday, I spoke at the Progress Iowa event in Des Moines to 250 Democratic activists and civic leaders.  It was a tremendous night for the campaign.  The response was phenomenal.</p>
<table style="border-style: hidden; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among the things people said to me afterwards:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Thank you for being here.  You made really important topics crystal clear in a way I’ve never heard before.” </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I was riveted from start to finish.”  She went on to buy a signed copy of my book for $125 to benefit Progress Iowa.  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I want to see more of you.  I loved what you said about women in particular.”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I want you to speak to my people.  When can we have you visit?”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I’ve seen a lot of candidates in my day.  You can finish at the top.” </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We came away with many new friends and a ton of new invitations for my next visit to Iowa in January.  You can see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzIfOxfoFlE">video</a> of my speech here, the text <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/blog/keynote-in-iowa-tonight-join-our-livestream/">here</a>, and press coverage <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/20/merkley-buttigieg-swalwell-and-yang-take-stage-iowa-dems-dinner-progress-iowa-caucus-2020-president/2383108002/">here</a>.  Our support in Iowa continues to grow; I am getting stopped on the street more and more as we travel the state.  One young man drove 5 hours to see me speak and wants to work on the campaign.  We will surprise everyone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the other speakers, I was particularly impressed with Pete Buttigieg, the Mayor of South Bend, Indiana.  He approached me afterwards with questions about how the economy is evolving.  I expect that Pete and I will work together in the future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In other important news, the DNC announced its <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/20/18150179/democratic-national-committee-2020-debate-schedule">plan</a> for its primary debates: 6 debates in 2019, followed by 6 debates in 2020.  The first two debates in June and July of 2019 are meant to be inclusive:  The DNC plans to have candidates mixed together, perhaps over two nights, to accommodate a larger group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is a golden opportunity for us.  We are being given every chance to make the debate stage.  If we are there, millions of Americans will hear our message and get the chance to compare our vision to that of Joe Biden and the other front runners.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The two criteria the DNC has announced for determining who participates in the debates are polling and ‘grassroots fundraising.’</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is where we need your help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have started to be included in national polls and expect to slowly climb the ranks.  But we need your help to demonstrate popular support.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please donate any amount today to show that you support this campaign.  This is particularly important if you have yet to contribute.  And then tell your friends, and spread the word.  The amount is less important than the number of people.  We have a filing deadline December 31<sup>st </sup>so time is of the essence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your belief and support.  This past week, hundreds of you have made new contributions – it has meant the world to me and the team.  With your help, we can change the course of history for our country.  Our path gets clearer to me with each passing day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s show what we can do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hug your families and get ready for a huge year in 2019.  I’m beyond excited for it.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">-Andrew</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">P.S.  The government shutdown and Mattis resigning may be a new low point for this administration – let’s get him out of there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the campaign launched in February, the <em>New York Times</em> called Andrew a “longer than longshot” candidate.</p>
<p>Since then we’ve had some real wins. Nearly every major news outlet has profiled Andrew. Donors and supporters from all over the country – South Carolina, North Dakota, Minnesota, and just about every other state – have stepped forward and said, “This is our campaign.”</p>
<p>Still, even our biggest supporters ask us: “Does Andrew really have a shot?”</p>
<p>We understand their disbelief. Andrew’s platform is bold, smart, and entirely new. This kind of political change never comes easy—and many are so jaded by American politics that it’s hard to believe meaningful progress is possible.</p>
<p>Here at HQ, we know we’re in for the fight of our lives. Andrew is going up against establishment politicians with multi-million dollar warchests. We can’t outraise the competition.</p>
<p>Our legitimacy is not going to come from fancy endorsements or press hits. It’s going to come from you.</p>
<p>So today, we’re asking you to give us one dollar.</p>
<p>It’s not about the money—it’s about what it demonstrates. It’s about showing the establishment that Andrew’s “radical” solutions aren’t so radical, and that thousands of voters across the country believe his ideas belong on the debate stage.</p>
<p><strong>We need 100,000 people to donate just $1 each to Yang2020 by the end of the year.</strong> If we pull this off, we’ll have the attention we need to contend in the primaries and change America’s political dialogue. Most importantly, Andrew’s vision won’t seem like such a longshot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>You can help us make this real.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a class="butnMed lightBlue" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/one-for-humanity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Please donate $1 and join One for Humanity today</strong></a></p>
<p>Does Andrew really have a shot?</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you’re one of the millions of Americans fed up with seeing Trump in the oval office, or you’re one of the silent masses eagerly awaiting Trump’s next political upset, we’ve all got one question right now: Who is running for President in 2020?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lucky for you, we are political nerds and did all the digging to bring you this extensive list of likely </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> contenders running for president in 2020.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><b>POLLING TOP 5 RIGHT NOW:</b></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1819 size-medium" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/1.-Biden-236x300.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/1.-Biden-236x300.jpg 236w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/1.-Biden.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px" /></p>
<h4><b>1. Joe Biden</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden is a former Vice President of the United States, serving under Barack Obama for eight years. He has been outspoken about climate change and is a vocal critic of president Donald Trump. He is originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania but served as democratic senator of Delaware from 1973-2009. As of October 2018, Joe Biden leads at 33% in democratic polls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joe Biden is seen as a champion of working-class people, fighting for middle-class tax cuts. He will likely have the endorsement and star power of Barack Obama working in his favor, should he run. In addition, there are a number of viral online </span><a href="https://theweek.com/articles/468552/6-best-onion-parodies-joe-biden"><span style="font-weight: 400;">parodies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by the satirical news outlet The Onion, portraying an alternate ‘Dynamite Joe’ Biden as a burnout slacker who drinks excessively and gets away with crimes. These are wildly popular with millennials and have worked to make him more appealing with this demographic.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1820" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2.-Bernie-237x300.jpg" alt="" width="237" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2.-Bernie-237x300.jpg 237w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/2.-Bernie.jpg 404w" sizes="(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px" /></p>
<h4><b>2. Bernie Sanders</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernie Sanders is a senator from Vermont and a self-proclaimed democratic socialist. He ran for president in 2016 but lost his party’s nomination to Hillary Clinton. Sanders has</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">already visited the early primary states and has been measured by the 538 political outlet as the most likely person to run for office in 2020. He is currently polling at 13%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernie’s platform includes Medicare for all and free college tuition, which makes him a favorite among millennial voters. He is seen as a stable, believable candidate since he’s been saying the same thing for years.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1821" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren-240x300.jpg 240w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren-768x960.jpg 768w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/3.-Warren.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /></p>
<h4><b>3. Elizabeth Warren</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elizabeth Warren is a Democratic senator from Massachusetts. She is a legal scholar and former economist who has proposed several ideas to fix capitalism in her recent book “This Fight Is Our Fight.” She worked in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and was a vocal proponent of breaking up ‘too big to fail’ banks after the financial crisis of 2008. She is also an outspoken critic of president Donald Trump. She is currently polling around 8%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warren will likely have some momentum following her ‘she persisted’ speech, which went viral in 2017. She could potentially capture some of the momentum from Bernie Sanders’ 2016 run if she embraces similar policies.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1822" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Booker-245x300.jpg" alt="" width="245" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Booker-245x300.jpg 245w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/4.-Booker.jpg 675w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px" /></p>
<h4><b>4. Cory Booker</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cory Booker is the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey and currently holds a Senate seat representing New Jersey. He has laid out a vision to revive schools in Newark and has also worked to drastically reduce violence in the city. Booker has visited several of the 2020 early primary states and polls in the top 5 Democratic candidates for president. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Booker is considered by many to be an inspiring speaker who understands how to use social media and build momentum with young people. Even though Booker is a progressive, he has proven to be willing to reach across the aisle and has worked with conservative Republicans to draft marijuana decriminalization legislation.  </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1823" src="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-218x300.jpg" alt="" width="218" height="300" srcset="https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-218x300.jpg 218w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-768x1056.jpg 768w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala-745x1024.jpg 745w, https://www.yang2020.com/wp-content/uploads/5.-Kamala.jpg 800w" sizes="(max-width: 218px) 100vw, 218px" /></span><b></b></h4>

She was an outspoken ‘no’ on Kavanaugh and is passionate about equal pay for women. She has also been outspoken about the need to protect children at the US border. She is currently polling around 9% or third place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris is a first-term senator and the new Starchild of the Democratic party. She is also a #MeToo champion and will most likely garner support from women &#8211; particularly women of color &#8211; should she decide to run.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>SECOND TIER CONTENDERS:</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of these possible 2020 presidential candidates will make you go, “Who?” There are many PROS here, but their relative anonymity is the major CON they all share.</span></p>

<h4><b>25. Andrew Yang </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">for president in 2020?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay! Now we are talking dark horses. According to the NY Times, Andrew Yang is a “longer-than-long shot” for the presidency.

He is a serial entrepreneur and founder of Venture For America (a non-profit that helped create thousands of jobs in places like Detroit and Baltimore). Yang is running on a platform of Universal Basic Income &#8211; giving every American adult $1,000 per month as a way to immediately reduce poverty and respond to automation displacing jobs. He has a total of <a href="http://www.yang2020.com/policies">73 policy positions listed on his </a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">website</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; the most of any candidate in the field. Many have said that “the opposite of Donald Trump: an Asian man who likes math.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew Yang is actually a bit more well-known than many of the Second Tier candidates listed above, and his ground game in Iowa and New Hampshire has been particularly strong. He has spoken at several Silicon Valley tech companies, including Google, and was recently interviewed on the </span><a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/130-universal-basic-income/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Harris podcast</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Yang is a self-professed ‘problem solver’ who understands emerging technologies. He has built companies and has a bold vision for the country.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like all of you, I was devastated by the events at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh this weekend.  It is heartbreaking that so many innocent lives were brutally taken in a place of worship and peace.</p>
<p>I feel particularly terrible and terrified for my Jewish friends.  So many have lost family members to violence and anti-Semitism across the years.  This weekend, their worst fears were realized here and now.  It is truly a nightmare come to life in America.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the shooter represents a larger trend. The shooter used a far-right alternative to Twitter that has 635,000 subscribers, up 50% from March of this year.  Anti-Semitic incidents were up 60% in 2017.  The bombs mailed to Democratic leaders this past week were born of a similar sense of hatred.  America is heading toward a dangerous spiral of political and ethnically charged violence as our institutional failure continues.</p>
<p>I <a title="Amazon link for The War on Normal People" href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Normal-People-Disappearing-Universal/dp/0316414247?keywords=war+on+normal+people&amp;qid=1540823356&amp;sr=8-1">wrote</a> last year:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">There will be more random mass shootings in the months ahead as middle-aged white men self-destruct and feel that life has no meaning.  As the mindset of scarcity spreads and deepens, people’s executive functioning will erode. Contributing to the discord will be a climate that equates opposing ideas or speech to violence and hate.  Anti-Semitic violence [will] break out&#8230; there are approximately 270 to 310 million firearms in the United States, almost one per human being.  We are the most heavily armed society in the history of mankind.  Disintegration is unlikely to be gentle.</p>
<p>Hateful rhetoric and the advent of Donald Trump have made things worse.  But after he is gone the hatred will not fade like a fever dream. It will be with us for years to come – and is likely to deepen, driven by increased economic stresses, changing demographics, and the ongoing disintegration of institutional authority.</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="Confidence in US Institutions - 1970 to 2017 (Declining)" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/60/attachments/original/image.png?1540822626" alt="Declining Confidence in US Institutions" width="392" height="309" /></p>
<p>We are heading in the wrong direction.  We need to think much bigger about how we can turn back the hate and improve our society.</p>
<p>Most politicians talk about how we need to love and understand each other and treat each other with respect.  Improved rhetoric and norms would help.  I confess though – I find this approach to be frustratingly vapid and ineffective even though I know it is part of the solution.</p>
<p>In practical terms, it is extraordinarily difficult to secure civilian locations and places of worship against armed attack.  It would require ubiquitous trained armed guards in a way that would transform the country and be extremely costly, and even then it wouldn’t work.  The Pittsburgh shooter wounded 3 highly trained police officers during his attack, for example.</p>
<p>It is more realistic, though still difficult, to make guns harder to get.  We should do <a title="Andrew Yang's Gun Control Policy Page" href="https://www.yang2020.com/policies/gun-control-second/">everything in our power</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fine gun manufacturers when their weapons are used in a mass shooting – $1 million per victim – to align their incentives with the public&#8217;s;</li>
<li>Establish licensing procedures for guns analogous to a driver&#8217;s license, and build in education and training;</li>
<li>Restrict gun ownership among those with a history of criminal behavior, mental illness, or domestic violence;</li>
<li>Raise the legal ownership age to 21;</li>
<li>Restrict private ownership of assault weapons and military-style weapons;</li>
<li>Create an ammunition registry;</li>
<li>Offer to buy back weapons, or upgrade firearms so they can only be fired by the owner;</li>
<li>Start a Helpline to allow for the identification of people who pose a danger to the public;</li>
<li>Invest in technology that would help track and identify weapons; and</li>
<li>Dramatically increase available mental health resources available to those who need help.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even here, though, these measures would not prevent anti-Semitic and racially motivated violence from rising in the years ahead.  America is set to become majority minority by 2045.  This will be a truly dangerous time as we are currently automating away the most common middle-class jobs, which will lead to economic stress, social polarization, anger, and violence. It&#8217;s already begun.</p>
<p>To me, the biggest, most positive move we can make is to replace the sense of scarcity with a sense of abundance and pass a Freedom Dividend of $1,000/month per adult.  This would alleviate stress levels, improve mental health, and decrease economic and social tensions.  It would give everyone a sense of security.</p>
<p>If you’re walking around worried about how to survive month-to-month you are more likely to lash out and respond to hateful messages and ideas.  We need to get people thinking about the future knowing that their place in it is assured.</p>
<p>Would a Universal Basic Income have prevented the violence in Pittsburgh?  Perhaps not – but I believe it would have a better chance of preventing the next one than just about anything else we could do.  And yes, that includes thoughts and prayers.</p>
<p>My greatest fear is that we slump into a world where the occasional shooting – even one as horrific as what happened in Pittsburgh – becomes something we become accustomed to.  We adapt to it.  That cannot be allowed to happen.  We must translate heartbreak into action.  We owe it to ourselves, our children, our fellow citizens, and the victims of the Tree of Life synagogue, Parkland, Sandy Hook, and every other recent massacre to overcome the gun lobby and get this right.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s fight for a future where Americans can pray without fear, and gather in peace.  It will require redefining our society in the ways that matter.  The challenge is historic and our solutions should be the same.</p>
