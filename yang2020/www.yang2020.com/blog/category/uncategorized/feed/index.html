								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, we held our long-anticipated outdoor rally in Washington Square Park in New York.  Our team had been planning this event for weeks in advance.  We were working around the clock to make it a success.  Then, we woke up Tuesday morning to find it was going to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We became worried that nobody would show up—but instead, when I arrived at the rally site, there were nearly 3,000 supporters gathered in the pouring rain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="The Crowd at Andrew Yang's Washington Square Park Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed_15.jpg?1557960557" alt="A field of umbrellas stretches across Washington Square Park - supporters waiting to hear Andrew Yang speak" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I realized we never should have doubted.  The Yang Gang is energized and ready to win this election.  A little rain won’t stop us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the rain had an upside: it shocked the reporters who were covering the rally in the media tent in the back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reporter even told my staff that he could not believe our massive turnout.  His exact words? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of this makes any sense!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Washington Square Park" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed-9.jpg?1557958675" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of a crowd in Washington Square Park, delivering a speech as the rain falls" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media is just catching on to what all of us have known for a long time now.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win this whole election and implement the Freedom Dividend to guarantee $1,000 per month for all Americans.  We can change this country and build a human-centered economy for all. </span></p>
<p><strong>We are drawing some of the largest crowds in the race and polling at 3% when most Americans have never heard of me.  </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the next few months, we are going to build on our momentum by hiring organizers in the critical early states, expanding our social media presence, and getting coverage in major national press outlets.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>But to achieve all those things, we need to be focused on one major goal between now and the FEC reporting deadline at the end of June—we need to raise $3.5 million.  Click here to contribute and help us reach our new goal.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it’s a pretty big number, but if we can meet this goal, we will DOUBLE our numbers from last quarter.  Imagine if we make it, {{recipient.first_name_or_friend}}.  Think about turning on CNN and seeing their reports that our fundraising numbers in July have captured the attention of the country. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>So I’m asking you today—chip in to help us raise $3.5M by the end of June.</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If everyone on this list donates $20, we will hit our goal instantly.  That is the MATH.  With your help, we make the case that we are the candidate to beat in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and hope you had a wonderful Mother’s Day weekend!  I spent it with both Evelyn and my mom.  We should all call our moms more often.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I was back in New Hampshire for our best trip yet.  At each stop, I talked about going to high school in New Hampshire and my path from my high school days to running for President.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We got our biggest crowds yet:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang in New Hampshire" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/543/attachments/original/190511_New_Hampshire_rally.jpg?1557765875" alt="Andrew Yang is surrounded by supporters after a rally in New Hampshire" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Addresses New Hampshirites" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/543/attachments/original/190511_New_Hampshire_church.jpg?1557763222" alt="Andrew Yang addresses supporters in New Hampshire" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And people noticed.  The events were written up in <a title="Yang starts to attract attention in NH" href="https://www.wmur.com/article/yang-starts-to-attract-attention-in-nh/27425380">Manchester</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang pitches ‘trickle up’ economy" href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190510/andrew-yang-pitches-trickle-up-economy">Seacoast Online</a>, <a title="Yang touts his 'tech check' at town hall event in Hollis" href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/national/yang-touts-his-tech-check-at-town-hall-event-in/article_b06e6bf2-b9d7-5c9b-9b12-4591ddd430be.html">Union Leader</a>, and other New Hampshire publications, as well as <a title="How Andrew Yang's Online Following Has Turned Into a Real-Life Coalition" href="http://time.com/5587792/andrew-yang-presidential-candidate/">TIME</a>, <a title="Once seen as extreme 2020 long shot, Yang is attracting some buzz" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/once-seen-as-extreme-2020-long-shot-yang-is-attracting-some-buzz">Fox</a>, and <a title="Is Andrew Yang ‘Too Nice’ to Beat President Trump?" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/andrew-yang-2020-president.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.  Among the descriptions:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Progressive, inclusive, and incredibly creative and smart.  His enthusiasm is not divisive &#8230; Yang is one to watch.”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Lightning in a bottle.”</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He&#8217;s my front-runner.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Yang has his eyes on the future.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He&#8217;s the first political candidate to actually get [many people] excited.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;[His campaign is] actually listening to people, taking people seriously, thoughtfully and in an analytical way.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He’s outside the box in a way that, whew, really charged, really evoked amazing insight.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also got a mention on Bill Maher as someone on the rise.  I’m scheduled to go on Bill Maher in early June.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere we went in New Hampshire, we were met with growing crowds and excitement.  I credit Steve Marchand for much of the buzz.  Steve ran for governor as a Democrat in 2018 and has now endorsed me. I haven’t been that big a fan of seeking political endorsements—I’m not sure how much they matter to voters, particularly the folks who have embraced our campaign.  But in Steve’s case, it is more personal than that; so many people like and admire him as someone they have worked with.  At every stop, people greeted him with hugs and smiles.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Steve and our NH State Director, Khrystina Snell, have deep relationships all over the state.  They will get us in front of the right people on every visit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have never felt better about our trajectory in New Hampshire.  This trip was electric.  We will contend and shock the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, we are gearing up for our <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in NYC" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">biggest rally yet in New York City</a> on Tuesday—ABC and many other major news outlets will be there, and 5,000 supporters have RSVPed.  It is going to be epic.  And then it’s on to <a title="Events Page with South Carolina Events Listed" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">our first visit to South Carolina</a> where we are presently <a title="‘The safe choice:’ Biden widens SC lead in 2020 Democratic presidential primary" href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/the-safe-choice-biden-widens-sc-lead-in-democratic-presidential/article_f727895c-731f-11e9-888a-af4280777b2a.html">polling at 2%</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your belief in me and the campaign have made all of this possible.  Thank you.  If you can make a donation today, please do so—we have the chance to make history.  Let’s make the most of it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your charged up candidate,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone, and Happy Martin Luther King Jr. Weekend!  I hope that you have plans to enjoy a great holiday with friends and family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I remember when Dr. King’s Birthday first became a national holiday.  It was 1986.  I was in sixth grade.  We were amazed that there would be a new holiday.  We watched MLK’s <em>I Have a Dream</em> speech in class.  It made a deep impression on that darkened classroom of 12-year-olds.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I watched the speech again in college in a U.S. History course 8 years later.  It struck me as even more profound then.  Martin Luther King Jr. may be the most powerful moral symbol in American history.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s something you might not know: Martin Luther King Jr. began advocating for a Universal Basic Income in the final year of his life.  Here&#8217;s a video of him speaking about it at Stanford in April, 1967:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><a title="MLK Jr's Speech on UBI (YouTube)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT2jpgSZSO0"><img title="MLK Jr. Speaking about UBI" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/119/attachments/original/mlk.gif?1547845756" alt="Martin Luther King Jr. delivers a speech on a universal basic income" width="230" height="230" /></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And here is a direct quote from his final book:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective – the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure: the</em> <em>guaranteed income.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">—Martin Luther King Jr., <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community?</span> (1967)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an <a href="https://medium.com/basic-income/mlk-on-guaranteed-income-bfd060fd5314">excerpt</a> from that book’s final chapter, most of which could be written today:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>We have [come a] long way in our understanding of human motivation and of the blind operation of our economic system. Now we realize that dislocations in the market operation of our economy and the prevalence of discrimination thrust people to idleness and bind them into constant or frequent unemployment against their will. The poor are less often dismissed from our conscience today by being branded as inferior and incompetent. We also never know that no matter how dynamically the economy develops and expands it does not eliminate all poverty. . . .We have so energetically mastered production that we now must give attention to distribution . . . </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>We are likely to find that the problems of housing and education, instead of [preceding] the elimination of poverty, will themselves be affected if poverty is first abolished. The poor transformed into purchasers will do a great deal on their own to alter housing decay . . . Beyond these advantages, a host of positive psychological changes inevitably will result from widespread economic security. The dignity of the individual will flourish when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands, when he has the assurance that his income is stable and certain, and when he knows that he has the means to seek self-improvement. Personal conflicts between husband, wife and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth on a scale of dollars is eliminated . . . </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The proposal is not a “civil rights” program, in the sense that the term is currently used. The program would benefit all the poor, including the two-thirds of them who are white. I hope that both Negro and white will act in coalition to affect this change, because their combined strength will be necessary to overcome the fierce opposition we must realistically anticipate.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>Our nation’s adjustment to a new mode of thinking will be facilitated if we realize that for nearly 40 years two groups in our society have already been enjoying a guaranteed income. Indeed, it is a symptom of our confused social values that these two groups turn out to be the richest and poorest. The wealthy who own securities have always had an assured income; and their polar opposite, the relief client, has been guaranteed an income, however miniscule, through welfare benefits.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The contemporary tendency in our society is to base our distribution on scarcity, which has vanished, and to compress our abundant condensed into the overfed mouth of the middle and upper class until [they] gag with superfluity . . . </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>The curse of poverty has no justification in our age. It is socially as cruel and blind as the practice of cannibalism at the dawn of civilization, when men ate each other because they had not yet learned to take food from the soil or to consume the abundant animal life around them. The time has come for us to civilize ourselves by the total, direct and immediate abolition of poverty.</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">—Martin Luther King Jr. (1967)</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He was assassinated a few months later, in April, 1968.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our tendency today is, I believe, to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.’s Birthday as an example of a dream realized.  He fought for racial equality, and with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that ended public segregation and banned employment discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, America became more just and equitable.  We celebrate his legacy every January as an example of the moral development of our country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">There is another interpretation though – that he was in the midst of his work and that work was cut short and left unfinished.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 1967, Martin Luther King Jr. had clearly turned his attention to a guaranteed minimum income as the next major Civil Rights issue of his time.  Even with MLK’s passing, a guaranteed income became a mainstream goal.  Milton Friedman was for it and 1,200 economists signed a <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/reports/90th%20Congress/Income%20Maintenance%20Programs%20Volume%20II%20(423).pdf">study</a> saying it would be great for both the economy and society.  A guaranteed national income even <a href="https://shift.newco.co/2016/08/30/when-basic-income-was-almost-an-american-reality/">passed</a> the House of Representatives four years later in 1971 under Richard Nixon.  Unfortunately, it stalled in the Senate and the moment was lost.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now, almost fifty years later, here we are, celebrating Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. How would he reflect on America in 2019?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">What would he want us to do – honor his memory, or further his work?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Basic Income helps those who have the least the most.  Women whose work is often unrecognized and uncompensated would have the freedom to improve their situations and/or walk away from abusive jobs or relationships.  Members of marginalized groups would have greater access to resources and paths forward.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I recently shared that a couple in Georgia, inspired by this campaign, is funding a Freedom Dividend of $12,000 for an individual or family in South Carolina later this year.  They reference Martin Luther King Jr.’s words in their pledge:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>People may wonder why ordinary citizens like us are willing to give up $12,000 to help virtual strangers. Our reason is simple. We are excited to be involved in a potential solution to one of our nation’s biggest problems: poverty. It puts the money back into the hands of one our nation’s biggest resources: our people, knowing that individuals, and not governments, know what is most needed to improve their life and their communities.  As Christians, we strongly believe in the idea of charitable giving. As people who fiercely believe in democracy, we understand that what Martin Luther King Jr. said was true: “If democracy is to have breadth of meaning, it is necessary to adjust this (economic) inequity. It is not only moral, but it is also intelligent. We are wasting and degrading human life by clinging to archaic thinking.”</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s truly celebrate Martin Luther King’s birthday the way he would want.  Let’s finish his work.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yours,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">December 31<sup>st </sup>is a crucial reporting deadline for the campaign.  We want to report a growing number of supporters each period – right now we are close but not quite there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="Andrew Yang ActBlue page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang">Please do make a contribution today</a> and let the establishment know that this campaign has the people on its side.  Every bit helps – particularly if you are a new donor.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is an invigorating thing to send an email to thousands of people and then actually have them take action in response.  Anytime you act it revs up both me and the team.  We remember when this campaign was getting started and our list was literally zero.  Now, our supporter base is in the tens of thousands and growing every day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And we are just getting started.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please make a donation by December 31<sup>st </sup>so you can be on the record.  And if you are near New York City for New Year’s Eve, <a title="EventBrite link for NYE Part" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yangs-new-years-eve-bash-tickets-53183646719">we are having a party, and we’d love for you to join us</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here’s to ending 2018 on a high note – and then making history in 2019.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/106/attachments/original/signature-blue.jpg?1546020620" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="137" height="75" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">-Andrew</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">P.S.  Seriously, December 31<sup>st </sup>is a reporting deadline and we need you to contribute now.  Thank you!!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and Happy Holidays to you and yours!  I hope you are enjoying a wonderful time with your family and loved ones.  I am writing this on the way to Florida where I am visiting my in-laws with my family.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last Thursday, I spoke at the Progress Iowa event in Des Moines to 250 Democratic activists and civic leaders.  It was a tremendous night for the campaign.  The response was phenomenal.</p>
<table style="border-style: hidden; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Among the things people said to me afterwards:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Thank you for being here.  You made really important topics crystal clear in a way I’ve never heard before.” </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I was riveted from start to finish.”  She went on to buy a signed copy of my book for $125 to benefit Progress Iowa.  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I want to see more of you.  I loved what you said about women in particular.”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I want you to speak to my people.  When can we have you visit?”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I’ve seen a lot of candidates in my day.  You can finish at the top.” </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We came away with many new friends and a ton of new invitations for my next visit to Iowa in January.  You can see a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzIfOxfoFlE">video</a> of my speech here, the text <a href="https://www.yang2020.com/blog/keynote-in-iowa-tonight-join-our-livestream/">here</a>, and press coverage <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2018/12/20/merkley-buttigieg-swalwell-and-yang-take-stage-iowa-dems-dinner-progress-iowa-caucus-2020-president/2383108002/">here</a>.  Our support in Iowa continues to grow; I am getting stopped on the street more and more as we travel the state.  One young man drove 5 hours to see me speak and wants to work on the campaign.  We will surprise everyone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of the other speakers, I was particularly impressed with Pete Buttigieg, the Mayor of South Bend, Indiana.  He approached me afterwards with questions about how the economy is evolving.  I expect that Pete and I will work together in the future.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In other important news, the DNC announced its <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/20/18150179/democratic-national-committee-2020-debate-schedule">plan</a> for its primary debates: 6 debates in 2019, followed by 6 debates in 2020.  The first two debates in June and July of 2019 are meant to be inclusive:  The DNC plans to have candidates mixed together, perhaps over two nights, to accommodate a larger group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is a golden opportunity for us.  We are being given every chance to make the debate stage.  If we are there, millions of Americans will hear our message and get the chance to compare our vision to that of Joe Biden and the other front runners.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The two criteria the DNC has announced for determining who participates in the debates are polling and ‘grassroots fundraising.’</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This is where we need your help.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have started to be included in national polls and expect to slowly climb the ranks.  But we need your help to demonstrate popular support.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Please donate any amount today to show that you support this campaign.  This is particularly important if you have yet to contribute.  And then tell your friends, and spread the word.  The amount is less important than the number of people.  We have a filing deadline December 31<sup>st </sup>so time is of the essence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you for your belief and support.  This past week, hundreds of you have made new contributions – it has meant the world to me and the team.  With your help, we can change the course of history for our country.  Our path gets clearer to me with each passing day.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s show what we can do.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hug your families and get ready for a huge year in 2019.  I’m beyond excited for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/105/attachments/original/signature-blue.jpg?1545609007" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="146" height="80" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">-Andrew</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">P.S.  The government shutdown and Mattis resigning may be a new low point for this administration – let’s get him out of there.</p>
