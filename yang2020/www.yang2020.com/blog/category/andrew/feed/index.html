								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year marks the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. In some ways, we as a country have made great strides in providing equal rights to LGBTQ+ individuals, highlighted by the decision in Obergefell in 2015. That Supreme Court decision had a tangible, positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans who were looking to receive equal recognition from their government for their families.</p>
<p>However, we can do a lot better at implementing policies that would make a difference in the lives of LGBTQ+ Americans. This is one of the reasons I think the Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month is the best policy for advancing our country.</p>
<p>A recent survey of LGBTQ+ individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 found that 1 out of 10 had experienced homelessness within the previous 12 months. This is driven in large part by losing support from their families simply for being who they are. The Freedom Dividend would provide these individuals with resources in order to start building their lives by moving to a new area or finding housing.</p>
<p>Additionally, passing a Medicare for All law with strong protections and coverage for all Americans would be especially beneficial to the LGBTQ+ community. This group often faces issues getting health insurance, or receiving treatment without facing discrimination. This is especially true for mental health issues, which are faced at triple the rate seen in the rest of the population. Under my presidency, everyone would have access to quality care that would address all issues without judgment or discrimination.</p>
<p>Everyone would also be free to serve in the military during my administration. Many generals and admirals agree that the current administration&#8217;s ban on transgender military service harms combat effectiveness and compromises the military&#8217;s values. I would be honored and humbled to serve as Commander in Chief to any patriot who is willing to sacrifice everything in order to protect our country.</p>
<p>Every American should be free to live the life that they want to live, without fear of homelessness, or being denied quality medical care, or being denied the honor of serving in our military. We can do better for LGBTQ+ Americans and all Americans.</p>
<p>We are all human, love is love, and people are people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello all and thank you for your support!  I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a busy week in the press for our campaign.  In addition to the recent <a title="Is Andrew Yang for Real?" href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/20/andrew-yang-2020-226931">Politico profile</a> and <a title="ActBlue CNN Page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cnnrankings">CNN putting me in its top 10</a>, </span><a href="http://time.com/longform/andrew-yang-2020-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME did a profile on my campaign</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a title="Andrew Yang Wants To Give You $1,000 A Month (HBO)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK5pWtlDVFk">VICE News also did a story on me</a>, which you can watch on HBO.  It’s a great reason to keep your subscription post-Game of Thrones.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang Profile in TIME" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/650/attachments/original/Screen_Shot_2019-05-30_at_9.24.28_AM.png?1559222758" alt="Andrew Yang cover story on TIME Magazine" width="100%" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to share a story with you from a supporter.  I believe it is stories like this one that are the reason we are seeing our campaign grow at such a rapid pace:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am 51 years old and have never voted. Me and my husband only receive $520 each per month on SSI and only $89 in SNAP. We have two twin sons that live with us. We recently moved into a home that was rented to us by someone who didn&#8217;t own the property. Now we are being forced out on the streets by the owner. But I am a fighter and will continue to do what I need for my family, I never met any candidate that was as honest and caring for people as I have seen in Andrew Yang and know from the bottom of my heart that he is the one that we need as President. We may not have much, but I try to donate as much as I can to help get him in the office. I know that Yang is our only hope for our future. I have committed myself to do whatever I can to get Andrew Yang to be our next President.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This campaign is doing so well because we are the only campaign talking about the big problems facing us as our economy transforms underneath our feet.  We are talking about a future where families do not have to feel stuck in place or hopeless.  They do not have to live with an economic boot on their necks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our success is also because we are powered by YOU—our average donation is only around $22 per person.  We don’t take any corporate PAC money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are slowly moving up in the polls and name recognition but we still have a long way to go. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=5?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=Organic&amp;utm_campaign=astory&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=190530LinkTop"><strong>Make a $5 contribution today and not only can we compete in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but we can take our message all the way to Washington when we win this entire election.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other politicians in the field are offering 20th century solutions to 21st century problems, we know the reality.  Automation is threatening over 20-30% of all American jobs in the next 11 years, and 90%+ of jobs created in the past decade are temporary, gig, or contract jobs, with no benefits or security.  Our government is dangerously behind the curve at dealing with emerging technologies and their impact on our way of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are taking a bold and innovative approach to the way we want to fix the problems facing this country, and I could not be more proud of the way we are doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have another story I want you to read—because it is the future of many American workers whether they realize it yet or not:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m a college educated, 40+, single, underpaid admin worker living in Seattle. My skill set will eventually become automated, and I have no real means or desire to get a graduate degree at this point to compete with younger generations, and I don&#8217;t want the debt of school weighing on me. I see the donations as an investment in my future; it feels pretty bleak otherwise. As someone who feels largely ignored by other candidates, I&#8217;m supporting Andrew Yang, whose Freedom Dividend will help everyone.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we started this race, we were called a ‘longer-than-long-shot’ campaign.  Well, this longer-than-long-shot has qualified for the first Democratic debates in June and July and is on pace to qualify for the Fall debates while sitting Representatives and Senators are still struggling to find their place on stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say we’re competing.  And it’s all because of you.  It’s why my name recognition is increasing in early primary states.  It’s why the media is finally paying attention.  It’s why we are going to qualify for the debates and why we are going to continue talking about the issues that politicians are too afraid to talk about. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=5?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=Organic&amp;utm_campaign=astory&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=190530LinkBottom"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Make a $5 contribution today and let’s keep gaining momentum.</strong></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win in 2020.  But we have to push to make sure it happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your help, we can make the case for a new vision for our country and take it all the way to the White House in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your grateful candidate,</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Memorial Day!  I hope you are enjoying a wonderful day with loved ones and family.</p>
<p>Memorial Day became a federal holiday in 1971, though it has been celebrated in some form since the 1860s.  Today, many Americans—especially those who have not experienced personal loss in this arena—have a natural inclination not to look too closely when it comes to the results of the wars we are fighting or have fought.  We are quick with a, &#8220;Thank you for your service.&#8221;  We are slow to think deeply about what it means that <a title="US Military Demographics" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=omAO4PhNPOfhCtXsiaKeG9S9O74ibB7P-_CGI0VNpYsXSMFPKTCoVVv9CTMvv-rSiQFinJkxTsCmdS2mQUBOdw&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=3&amp;test_email=1">less than one percent of our population serves</a>, and that even within our 50 states, <a title="Enlistment Rates by State" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=GUadKUZbNtXpoQtrN7XiLlDAp0T1nvsEvUIUmB084zET-S2kIYZIBXbjoxx2SZQHQqfYORkMeYrZhRQNzRvmSQY3Z9mo89cWnLHvG1N7liAnb9dPmh2LsIQdvaZeVW7Y&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=4&amp;test_email=1">there is a marked difference in enlistment rates</a>, and that <a title="NAMI: Veterans &amp; Active Duty" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=HR0zXZcA2EhSsHwYdNaPOElY_UFTH18Q_a-4zuONy9hwUIJv-xNaxbdZW1dNrIfbdBYe64xW8npcfexw0SuPYQ&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=5&amp;test_email=1">25% of our active duty members and veterans</a> show signs of PTSD and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>To this end, I asked a member of my staff who is a veteran what he would ask of Americans on this Memorial Day.  He recommended an essay that struck a chord with me—<a title="The Warrior at the Mall" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=PiInCVHjZg_Lhb0RQ-dhd-f9dUtA9BFLkPKeNFGdc9IsXFjp9I5xqC5iRDo_w7IeFFUykXMjsG8fSxb2-A_ZQ2DGhEGil4WNRTiB8Hknn0c&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=6&amp;test_email=1">Phil Klay&#8217;s <em>The Warrior at the Mall</em></a>.  The essence of Mr. Klay&#8217;s argument is that, as a result of the same minority of Americans spending decades at war while an overwhelming majority carries on with their lives as if nothing is amiss, a chasm has opened up between civilians and veterans.  This chasm must be bridged, or, as Mr. Klay says:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We risk our country slipping further into the practice of a fraudulent form of American patriotism, where &#8216;soldiers are sacred,&#8217; the work of actual soldiering is ignored and the pageantry of military worship sucks energy away from the obligations of citizenship.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Mr. Klay also points out</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Support for our military remains high at a time when respect for almost every other institution is perilously low, so pushing a military angle as a wedge makes a certain kind of sense.  But &#8230; our military is justified only by the civic life and values it exists to defend.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That is, we don&#8217;t believe in much these days beyond our military.  But the military exists to defend our society itself.</p>
<p>Thus, we owe it to our veterans to take our citizenship seriously enough that it warrants their sacrifices.</p>
<p>If there is a way that we can celebrate this Memorial Day beyond reflecting on and thanking our veterans and members of the armed services for all they have done and given up, it would be to try to become more worthy of their sacrifice.  This includes examining our decisions to put our soldiers into harm&#8217;s way and how we treat and support them after they return.  It even includes how we treat ourselves and other members of our society.</p>
<p>I met with a veterans&#8217; organization this week to learn about their experiences.  Both of the officials I met with served in the Middle East in the Marine Corps.  Now they work at an organization that tries to end the &#8216;Forever Wars&#8217; and advocates for Congress regaining its say on military deployments which have fallen solely to the executive branch since 2001.  That is where their patriotism and service has led them.</p>
<p>We can do better.  We will do better.  For our veterans and the country they sacrificed so much for.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, I’ve been running for President for a while.  Our campaign publicly <a title="His 2020 Campaign Message: The Robots Are Coming" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html">launched in February of 2018 in the <em>New York Times</em></a>. Still, most people had never heard of me.  This led to many awkward conversations that went like this:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“So what kind of work do you do?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“I’m running for President of the United States.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“Um, really?  Uh, good luck with that.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“Thanks.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a non-crazy person, this was not a terribly pleasant interaction.  It also tended to derail conversations, we would often just start talking about the campaign.  So in some situations, I would say something vague. “I’m working on a campaign to help manage the impact of technology on the workforce,” or, “I’m an author.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I know, in theory, I should have been telling the milkman about the <a title="FAQ about the Freedom Dividend and UBI" href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/">Freedom Dividend</a>, but sometimes you just want to get the milk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The odds of me getting recognized in public were quite low.  The odds were higher when I was dressed up—wearing a blue suit or blazer with a circular logo on it tends to draw attention.  So does wearing a red, white, and blue scarf.  But when I was just walking around incognito, I was a total non-entity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An example of my relative anonymity—I gave a talk at my son’s school for parents and teachers. Very few people showed up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, most people weren’t paying the slightest bit of attention to 2020 in 2018.  This started to change in 2019.  The awareness level of me and the campaign picked up a great deal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first time I was recognized out on the street in plainclothes, I was taken aback.  I was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.  I figured no one would notice an anonymous Asian man and his son going to the deli.  But the guy in line behind me looked at my face and said, “Hey, are you Andrew Yang?”  I nodded. He was like, “I love you, man!” and asked for a photo.  I said sure, and then felt self-conscious that I looked so off-duty.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another time, a woman came up to me and said, “Are you Andrew Yang?”  And before I could answer, she said, “No, no you’re not,” and walked away.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other day, I counted up 10 times that I was recognized on the street.  Most people are incredibly nice and gracious.  A lot of people will just yell, “Yang Gang!” or, “Good luck!” or, “I support you!”  Many people take their phones out and want a photo, which I’m happy to provide.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, this is fantastic progress.  I am running for President.  Getting recognized is a sign that what we are doing is working.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But I’ll confess that it’s been a bit of an adjustment.  Now, when I walk around, there’s a sense that someone is watching.  I saw someone surreptitiously take a photo of me with my family the other day on their phone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zach said to me, “You’d better get used to it—you’re going to be the leader of the free world.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other day when I got home from campaigning, Evelyn asked me, “How was your trip?”  I said, “It was great!  Thousands of people came to the rally.  Check this out.”  I then pulled up video and photos from the event.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She said, “Wow, that looks huge!  Sometimes I feel like you’re this public figure, and you come home to your alter ego.  Go play with the boys.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I pride myself on being a pretty regular guy.  The plan is to stay human and integrated the whole time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Getting recognized on the street is fun in the context of the campaign.  It will be a small price to pay to accomplish our goals.  I appreciate all of the support we get.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Can someone go from utterly anonymous to President in the space of 2 years?  It’s never been done, but things move very fast in this era, for better or worse.  My encounters on the street suggest that there are a lot of people who like me and the campaign but aren’t yet taking action.  Let’s move them into the action column.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you see me out and about, feel free to grab me and ask for a selfie.  If you say, “I donated to your campaign,” you’ll get a big smile.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for the support!  It means a ton to me and the team.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spent the past weekend in South Carolina and had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of amazing, hard-working Americans.  And, like all Americans, they are worried about the future for their families.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang's First Trip to South Carolina" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/599/attachments/original/south_carolina.jpg?1558532378" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of an auditorium, addressing a large crowd of South Carolinians" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like me, you associate drinking water issues in America with Flint, Michigan.  But that&#8217;s just the most visible of dozens of communities around the country that are struggling with their water supply.  In Denmark, South Carolina, a chemical not approved by the EPA was used for a decade to decontaminate the water, leading to health issues for residents there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine having kids who have been drinking water for years and now knowing that their health might be damaged as a result.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As our infrastructure falls into disrepair and there is less and less money to fix it, these problems will only get worse.  The EPA has estimated that it would cost $384 billion over a ten-year period to properly fix and maintain our water systems.  We live in the wealthiest nation in the world, and we must be able to guarantee clean drinking water for each of our citizens.  When I’m President, we will invest the resources needed to guarantee clean drinking water to all Americans as a basic right.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina recently made national news because the schoolteachers there went on strike for better pay and benefits.  They rank 38<sup>th </sup>nationwide on teacher pay.  Teachers are vital to our future, and when teachers aren’t able to make a decent living, we lose the best of them to other opportunities.  When I’m President, I plan to make sure teachers get paid more—the data shows that a good teacher is worth their weight in gold in terms of driving better educational outcomes for dozens of students each year.  Instead of nickel-and-diming teachers, we should be treating them like professionals and giving them the flexibility to do their jobs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While increasing teacher pay is important, making things better in the classroom is just part of the fight.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Only 25-30% of our kids’ performance in schools is attributable to what happens in school.  The rest of it is due to factors outside of school—parental time and income, number of words read to a child, stress levels, type of neighborhood, etc.  Educators know this.  We are putting them in an impossible situation where we expect them to educate our children, who are distracted by issues at home.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing we can do to set teachers up for success is to get the Freedom Dividend into the hands of all Americans so that our families are stronger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=10"><strong>That’s why I’m running.  Because we need to start putting forward real solutions that will directly improve people’s lives.  I need you to help me make these solutions a reality.  If you can, please donate $10 to our movement.  I genuinely appreciate it.</strong></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Each time I visit a new state, I’m more certain that what we are doing is vital to our nation’s future.  There are so many Americans out there who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s invest in our people, our families, and our communities so that we can build a better future together.  We do not have unlimited time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your grateful candidate,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, we held our long-anticipated outdoor rally in Washington Square Park in New York.  Our team had been planning this event for weeks in advance.  We were working around the clock to make it a success.  Then, we woke up Tuesday morning to find it was going to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We became worried that nobody would show up—but instead, when I arrived at the rally site, there were nearly 3,000 supporters gathered in the pouring rain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="The Crowd at Andrew Yang's Washington Square Park Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed_15.jpg?1557960557" alt="A field of umbrellas stretches across Washington Square Park - supporters waiting to hear Andrew Yang speak" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I realized we never should have doubted.  The Yang Gang is energized and ready to win this election.  A little rain won’t stop us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the rain had an upside: it shocked the reporters who were covering the rally in the media tent in the back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reporter even told my staff that he could not believe our massive turnout.  His exact words? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of this makes any sense!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Washington Square Park" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed-9.jpg?1557958675" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of a crowd in Washington Square Park, delivering a speech as the rain falls" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media is just catching on to what all of us have known for a long time now.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win this whole election and implement the Freedom Dividend to guarantee $1,000 per month for all Americans.  We can change this country and build a human-centered economy for all. </span></p>
<p><strong>We are drawing some of the largest crowds in the race and polling at 3% when most Americans have never heard of me.  </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the next few months, we are going to build on our momentum by hiring organizers in the critical early states, expanding our social media presence, and getting coverage in major national press outlets.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>But to achieve all those things, we need to be focused on one major goal between now and the FEC reporting deadline at the end of June—we need to raise $3.5 million.  Click here to contribute and help us reach our new goal.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it’s a pretty big number, but if we can meet this goal, we will DOUBLE our numbers from last quarter.  Imagine if we make it.  Think about turning on CNN and seeing their reports that our fundraising numbers in July have captured the attention of the country. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>So I’m asking you today—chip in to help us raise $3.5M by the end of June.</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If everyone on this list donates $20, we will hit our goal instantly.  That is the MATH.  With your help, we make the case that we are the candidate to beat in 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">We were in Des Moines the other day wrapping up a town hall.  It was Zach, Carly, Luke, and I.  It was raining and chilly.  Our white Chevy Suburban was parked far across the parking lot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at each other for a second.  Were we all going to go to the car in the rain?  Or was someone going to run to the car and drive it over for the rest of us?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zach quickly said, “I’ll run out and get the car,” and then dashed into the rain while the rest of us waited.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After he pulled up, we piled in.  Carly said, “That was such a dad move, Zach.”  It’s true.  That’s the sort of thing I do with my family all of the time.  I go and get the car in harsh elements while they wait under shelter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So then I said, “Wait a minute.  If Zach is the Dad of this family, what am I?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Zach and Andrew Share a Bite to Eat" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/519/attachments/original/Image_from_iOS.jpg?1557330020" alt="Zach sits in the driver's seat eating food with Andrew" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And then it dawned on me—I&#8217;m the baby.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I realized a bunch of things very quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">People are taking care of me all of the time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Staffers have my favorite foods around.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">If I get in a bad mood, everyone around me suffers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">My schedule determines everyone else’s.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Others are grooming me, sometimes several times a day.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The parallels were eerie.  Zach is the patient Dad.  Carly, the energetic sister.  Luke is the quiet son.  And I am the kid around which the world revolves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to understand how close you get on the campaign trail.  You literally wake up together in an Airbnb, eat together, ride together in a car for hours on end, and coordinate every part of your day.  It is very intense.  You are in tight proximity to each other for hours and hours.  I’ve noticed that some other candidates travel with actual family members for this reason.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad to say that the team and I enjoy our time on the road, even when it gets tiring.  We get along famously.  Good thing, because we travel a lot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m incredibly grateful to the people on the campaign team.  Most joined before I had any level of public recognition.  They saw something in me and my ideas.  Many took huge pay cuts because they saw the chance to have a huge impact.  Their talent level and idealism are both sky high.  This campaign attracts amazing people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m accustomed to being the father figure—the CEO of a business, the head of a non-profit, and, of course, being an actual dad.  I hope to be the leader of a revolution that transforms the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many times on the campaign where I’m the person being taken care of instead of the opposite.  And I’m grateful for it.  Let someone else run into the rain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re heading throughout New Hampshire to <a title="Andrew Yang Dartmouth Town Hall" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-at-dartmouth-tickets-60974555537">Hanover</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang and the Upper Valley Democrats" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/yang-in-the-upper-valley-nh-tickets-61004211238">Lebanon</a>, <a title="Meet &amp; Greet with Andrew Yang in Concord" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/coffee-with-andrew-yang-tickets-61115505121">Concord</a>, <a title="Humanity First Rally in Portsmouth" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-portsmouth-nh-tickets-61004410835">Portsmouth</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang and the Sullivan County Democrats" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-claremont-nh-tickets-61004641525">Claremont</a>, <a title="Town Hall with Andrew Yang in Hollis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-hall-with-andrew-yang-tickets-61050374313">Hollis</a>, <a title="Meet &amp; Greet with Andrew Yang in Windham" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-windham-nh-tickets-61114022687">Windham</a>, and <a title="Pot Luck Supper with Andrew Yang in Milford" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-milford-nh-tickets-61044854804">Milford</a>. If you can make it, or have a friend in the area, please do come or let them know.  We will be traveling with Steve Marchand, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Hampshire who just endorsed me.  His endorsement made the nightly <a title="Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Marchand endorses Andrew Yang" href="https://www.wmur.com/article/former-democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-steve-marchand-endorses-andrew-yang/27172864"><u>news</u> in New Hampshire</a> and <a title="We’ve updated our N.H. primary rankings and there’s a new front-runner" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/new-hampshire/2019/05/03/updated-our-primary-rankings-and-there-new-frontrunner/cTA3STmZQoApt4jUbtpJdI/story.html">the Boston Globe</a> and has made waves throughout the state.  Thanks to Steve, we are growing in New Hampshire very quickly.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for the support!  It means a ton to us.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This weekend was a lot of fun.  We started in Seattle where we were greeted by a crowd of thousands.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Seattle" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/490/attachments/original/IMG_3385.jpg?1557152215" alt="Andrew Yang, with Seattle in the background, delivers a speech to supporters" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The rally in Seattle was enormous on a beautiful day.  <a title="K5 News Story on Andrew Yang's Seattle Rally" href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/2020-presidential-hopeful-andrew-yang-campaigns-in-seattle/281-8f9e25aa-e307-4059-a496-b8622750469b">We made the evening news</a>, which is always great.  I enjoy the thought of people turning on their evening news and seeing a crowd of thousands of their neighbors rallying for the Freedom Dividend and a more human economy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The YangGang has been strong in Seattle from Day One.  It may be because Seattle itself is being transformed by the advent of technology.  Housing costs have skyrocketed in certain areas.  A friend of mine who works at Amazon said, “It’s no secret that we are trying to make our own jobs obsolete.  Management doesn’t pretend otherwise.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A neuroscientist in Seattle said to me, “We need Universal Basic Income in the worst way.  The biggest obstacle is the human mind.”  He meant that we are wired for resource scarcity.  He’s right.  Moving people toward abundance is both our greatest challenge and opportunity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Next, it was on to Detroit, which has been on the receiving end of automation.  It was the epicenter of hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs that have disappeared.  Its population has declined from 1.8 million to less than half that.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have spent a lot of time in Detroit—I’ve been there every year since 2011 with Venture for America. The city has made a lot of progress since then.  We drew hundreds of people to the Detroit Shipping Company.  Among the people I met there were Lacey, a truck driver who sees what is coming down the pike, and Derek, a military vet who has become an activist for mental health issues.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Detroit" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/490/attachments/original/IMG_3389.jpg?1557152379" alt="Andrew Yang addresses a crowd of supporters " width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I learned a lot from the people of Detroit over the years.  They have been doing the hard work building up their neighborhoods and communities.  Some people regard Detroit as a symbol of America’s industrial past—it is more accurately an emblem of America’s future as our economy continues to transform.  Many towns and communities in the Midwest will increasingly resemble Detroit if we automate truck driving and the trucks don’t need to stop anymore.  As Derek said, “It’s incredible what we let happen to Detroit.  Half the suburbs in this country are going to look like Detroit if we don’t do something about it.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One issue that is common to Detroit and many other communities—urban blight.  It is expensive to tear down buildings properly.  If a municipal budget goes down, it becomes almost impossible to remove derelict buildings that then bring down property values and become havens for crime.  Detroit alone has about 30,000 derelict homes and buildings, with 30,000 more on the edge of abandonment.  One thing that I will do as President is commit Federal funds to a domestic infrastructure force that can help communities clear out or repurpose derelict buildings for redevelopment.  We need to become better at helping communities reconfigure themselves in the new economy.  It will also create work in many environments.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We will be back in Detroit for the DNC debates in July, and I’m excited for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Sunday, it was on to Minneapolis.  The #YangGang there is strong—1,000 people came out to Boom Island Park.  Minnesota has been a blue state for a while, but recently it has become more competitive as many rural voters went to Trump.  Minneapolis is something of the progressive haven in the state.  I talked about why the folks in other parts of the state seem to be increasingly distressed. They see an economy that doesn’t work for them or their kids as rural areas become more depleted and main street stores close.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Minneapolis" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/490/attachments/original/190505_MSP_%281%29.jpg?1557153233" alt="Andrew Yang's crowd of supporters in Minneapolis" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Minnesota votes early in the primaries on Super Tuesday in March.  Also of note—Minneapolis is only 2 hours from the Iowa border.  If the #YangGang gets excited enough, we could draw people from Minnesota to campaign in Iowa ahead of the caucuses.  We will come back to Minneapolis—St. Paul for sure; I enjoyed the heck out of it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was invigorating to see so many Americans pumped up about me and the campaign all over the country.  We can make the changes that we seek together if we wake up our fellow citizens to the power that we collectively wield.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Our campaign is gaining steam all of the time.  <a title="Presidential candidate Andrew Yang’s plan for universal basic income" href="https://www.today.com/video/presidential-candidate-andrew-yang-s-plan-for-universal-basic-income-58900549612">We were featured on the Today Show</a> this Sunday, and I’ll be doing more media this week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I am <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">heading to New Hampshire later this week</a>, and then, on May 14<sup>th</sup>, we will have <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in New York City" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">our biggest rally yet in Washington Square Park</a> in New York City.  Thousands of people from around the country will be there. Tell your friends in New York to make the trip—it will be a ton of fun.  We are going to bring the media to the rally—let’s build a crowd that will make them stand up and take notice.  It’s not Left or Right; it’s Forward.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your forward-looking candidate,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello and thank you for your support!  It means a ton to me and the team.</p>
<p>I’m writing this on the plane out West—we are having a rally in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Seattle" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-seattle-wa-tickets-59624294871">Seattle on Friday</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Detroit" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-detroit-michigan-tickets-60845631923">Detroit on Saturday</a>, and <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Minneapolis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-minneapolis-mn-tickets-59674699633">Minneapolis on Sunday</a>, and are stopping in the Bay Area for a day first to say hello to some people there.</p>
<p>Someone asked the other day whether it’s me writing these emails.  Yep.  It’s me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Writing a Newsletter" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/473/attachments/original/IMG_2859.jpg?1556796605" alt="An over-the-shoulder shot of Andrew writing this very newsletter on his laptop on a plane to California" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I tend to write these emails in transit from one place to another.  I enjoy processing what’s happening in the campaign.  I find it a useful way to recharge.</p>
<p>I was talking to my wife last night about introverts who are/were politicians.  It’s probably not the norm.  Having met Barack Obama several times, I believe that he qualifies.  After meeting him, my wife said, “For an introvert, he seemed very personable.”</p>
<p>I was a very nerdy, bookish kid.  My favorite thing to do was read books.  As a kid, I devoured biographies of Native American leaders and fantasy books: Dragonlance, Piers Anthony, Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey.  I played <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with my brother and our neighbors growing up, and later moved on to video games.</p>
<p>I struggled with various social interactions throughout my adolescence, particularly when people started drinking.  I went from nerdy kid to somewhat mopey adolescent, listening to the Smiths and the Cure.  I was in the high school play and joined the debate team.  But I was still the last person that anyone thought would become a politician much less run for President. My high school yearbook <a title="The Yearbook Photos of the 2020 Presidential Candidates" href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/the-yearbook-photos-of-the-2020-presidential-candidates.html">photo recently appeared in <em>New York Magazine</em></a>. I suppose my fashion choices are proof that I’d never intended to run for anything.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/473/attachments/original/yang_high_school.png?1556813972" alt="yang_high_school.png" width="269" height="457" /></p>
<p>I had a bit of a chip on my shoulder, and started working out and playing basketball in my late-teens. Going to the gym became another way to process things.</p>
<p>I noticed recently that my emails have become a bit similar.  They say something like, “Look how much awesome progress we are making!  Here are some news clippings and photos!  We are going to grow and grow and shock the world!”</p>
<p>All of which is real and sincere.  I mean, it’s staggering how far we’ve come.  Now that we are cool, I realize just how uncool we were until recently. #YangGang.  I appreciate all of the creativity and artwork that people are producing—including the good memes.  People being excited enough about this campaign to put their time and energy into it is awesome.  Thank you for believing in me.</p>
<p>But there will be more to this campaign and my speaking to you than simply cataloging our recent achievements.</p>
<p>My recent emails have fallen into what I’d consider “Executive Mode.”  Building an organization—or a presidential campaign—includes advancing certain variables and deliverables.  As an executive, you focus on them and try to move them forward.</p>
<p>Let’s say you were running for President:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you become known to more Americans?  Let’s do some press interviews, starting with podcasts.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you become politically viable?  Let’s make 11 trips each to New Hampshire and Iowa and start schmoozing with Democratic activists there.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you raise millions of dollars to fund a campaign?  Let’s put a vision out to our fellow Americans that gets people excited about building a movement for a new human-centered economy.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">How do you build a massive following?  <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Hold big and exciting rallies around the country</a> for thousands of supporters.  The press will see the crowds and respond.</p>
<p>Making progress on these variables requires a constant array of distinct behaviors.  E.g., yesterday, I woke up, went to a TV studio, put makeup and hairspray on, and had a 6-minute conversation on a cable news program.  Then I filmed various messages for online ads.  Then I did a Town Hall.  My communications become a summary of these activities.  “We did this, and then we did this and we made progress. Isn’t it great?”</p>
<p>This is a written form of executive communication.  I will do my fair share of it—it is my job—but I promise to go beyond it to give you some genuine insight into what running for President actually entails and what the process is.  It will be better for me too.</p>
<p>As an adult, I remained an introvert, but I found myself developing different capacities.  Mainly because I revolted when I found out it was supposed to be my job to process other people’s documentation as a corporate attorney.  I was like, “No way this is what I’m going to do for a living.  I need to figure something else out.”  I was willing to adopt behaviors that were very uncomfortable for me at the time to reach certain goals.  Putting myself out there.  Selling an idea for a company.  Asking women out on dates. (I am now grateful to be married.)  Over time, those behaviors became, if not second nature, at least things I could do in service of something I felt strongly about.</p>
<p>I even started throwing parties in my late twenties.  It was a way to socialize and be cool when I didn’t have an apartment to host anything (I wasn’t making much money).  I remember distinctly walking home alone, late at night, stone cold sober after a big party that had included hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Throwing parties was perhaps the best training for a presidential campaign.  Years later, my organization Venture for America had an annual gala that drew hundreds of people.  I’d give a speech each year.  Starting and running a national non-profit involved a lot of speaking and presenting a vision.  I joked that I felt like a priest, where my job was to show up and bless things.</p>
<p>This is, I believe, how an introvert finds himself running for President.  You have certain goals.  You realize that the only way to make them happen is certain behaviors. You get better at those behaviors. Eventually, you find yourself with a goal so big that it is almost impossible—prepare society for the automation of labor that is already tearing us apart.  Keep the country whole.  There is a vanishingly short list of ways to meaningfully do so.</p>
<p>I’ve said in various forums that I don’t much care for the actual job of being a politician.  It’s true.  I think one of the reasons we despair for our future is that politicians traffic in certain behaviors and get rewarded for them.  There is little need for deep thought or consideration.  We lurch from press release to press release, from cable news appearance to cable news appearance, from speech to speech, with the constant buzz of our approval and popularity in the background.  And money is tied to that approval.  At first, I was horrified that how many social media follows I got was now a key deliverable.  I was like, “I’m a grown man now evaluating myself like an eighth-grader.”  (<em>Eighth Grade</em> was a good movie.)</p>
<p>But I adapted. Because I have a job to do.</p>
<p>We all do.</p>
<p>I will do what it takes to get this job done.  We are off to a tremendous start thanks to all of you.  We have the capacity to change the course of our country for the better.  But I need your help.</p>
<p>The title of this email was taken from a slogan adopted by the fans of an NBA Team, the 76ers, who had a highly introverted GM for a number of years, Sam Hinkie.  He wrote <a title="Sam Hinkie's Resignation Letter" href="https://www.espn.com/pdf/2016/0406/nba_hinkie_redact.pdf">a resignation letter</a> that became something of a cult hit.  Many of his ideas have since been adopted by other teams.</p>
<p>This campaign is going to be a triumph of big ideas and solutions over the churn of politics as usual.  There is an enormous appetite for a different kind of movement.  Let’s provide it.  It’s not Left or Right, it’s Forward.  Let’s do the job that history has left for us.</p>
<p>Do something that makes you uncomfortable today.  It is part of the process.  And be sure to <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">come to a rally if we&#8217;re hosting one near you</a>.</p>
<p>Energized by you all,</p>
<p><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/473/attachments/original/andrewyangsignature.jpg?1556797720" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="136" height="75" /></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello and thank you for the support!</p>
<p>We just got back from 4 days in Iowa.  As you know, Iowa is the first state to vote and will be crucial in 2020.</p>
<p>I have been visiting Iowa since last summer, when I spoke at the <a title="Andrew Yang at the Iowa Wing Ding" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkH0xGUgR0c">Wing Ding</a>.  I have returned every month since.</p>
<p>This time was different.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Town Hall in Iowa" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/453/attachments/original/IMG_3343.jpg?1556634655" alt="An auditorium filled with Iowans listening to Andrew Yang describe his vision for the future of America" width="100%" /></p>
<p>We drew a crowd of hundreds to a Town Hall in Des Moines with JD Scholten, a political icon in Iowa who is fighting for the working class.  People drove from hours away to attend.  The crowd included people wearing <a title="Buy a MATH hat" href="https://shop.yang2020.com/collections/new-arrivals/products/math-hat">MATH hats</a> and people who were simply curious.</p>
<p>Among the things I heard from excited Iowans:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“My son told me I had to come see you.  He’s already decided to caucus for you.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“I read your book and have been giving it to everyone I know.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You converted me.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>“You will be the first person I ever caucus for.”</em></p>
<p>Folks then waited for up to an hour afterwards for selfies and to meet.  That wasn’t happening in 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Meets with Supporters in Iowa" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/453/attachments/original/IMG_3344.jpg?1556634738" alt="Andrew Yang high fives a supporter after his Iowa Town Hall" width="100%" /></p>
<p>I also spoke at the Democracy Ball in Boone County, a rural forum in Stuart, and several other events.  Everywhere we went there was a ton of energy and interest in the campaign.  It felt very much like we had turned a corner.</p>
<p>We weren’t alone—journalists from the Washington Post and Politico were with us tracking the campaign. That wasn’t happening in 2018 either. We will compete in Iowa as our campaign gains traction.  I made appearances on CNN and <a title="Where Andrew Yang stands on 2020 issues" href="https://www.msnbc.com/weekends-with-alex-witt/watch/where-andrew-yang-stands-on-2020-issues-1511459907882">MSNBC</a> from Des Moines.</p>
<p>We are growing all of the time.  But we need your help.  Though our April fundraising is ahead of our Q1 pace of $1.7 million, it is not growing fast enough.  We will have to demonstrate major growth in order to contend in the days ahead.  If you have the ability to do so, <a title="Andrew Yang's ActBlue Donation Page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang">please do make a donation today</a>.  This is particularly important if you haven’t donated, as we are trying to reach 200,000 donors by the debates in June.  You can also <a title="Yang2020 Store" href="https://shop.yang2020.com/">buy some swag</a>—we are told that people shout “Yang Gang!” at you on the street if they spot a fellow supporter.</p>
<p>Your donation will pay off.  We are already polling at 3% in <a title="Emerson Polling for Texas" href="https://emersonpolling.reportablenews.com/pr/2020-texas-biden-and-beto-in-dead-heat-in-democratic-primary">Texas</a> and <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/436641-biden-sanders-top-2020-democratic-field-in-nevada-poll">Nevada</a>, and the New York Times recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/29/us/politics/democratic-primary-debates-2020.html">noted</a> that we are one of only 8 candidates to qualify for the debates via both polling and donations.  We are drawing crowds of hundreds or even thousands to our <a title="Humanity First Tour Schedule" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">Humanity First rallies</a> around the country.  This week we will be in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Seattle" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-seattle-wa-tickets-59624294871">Seattle</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in Detroit" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-detroit-michigan-tickets-60845631923">Detroit</a>, and <a title="Minneapolis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-minneapolis-mn-tickets-59674699633">Minneapolis</a> before heading to <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour in Portsmouth" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-portsmouth-nh-tickets-61004410835">New Hampshire</a> and our biggest rally yet in <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Tour in NYC" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">New York City</a>.</p>
<p>We can change the course of our nation’s history.  But we will have to dig deep—and demonstrate ourselves that people matter more than money.  Americans are hungry for this message.  I see it every day.</p>
<p>On a personal level, I appreciate your donations because they mean that we can demonstrate our grassroots support, and I can focus on growing our base instead of doing the money chase.  It is incredibly empowering.  You all make me stronger.</p>
<p>Let’s show what we can do.</p>
<p><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/453/attachments/original/andrewyangsignature.jpg?1556628394" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="136" height="75" /></p>
