								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Zach Graumann, Andrew&#8217;s campaign manager. I&#8217;ve been working with Andrew since the early days when we operated out of an apartment. We knew we had a real shot to win this election then. Today, thanks to you, we’re more confident than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Andrew emailed you about <a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-linktop">our new goal of raising $3.5 million by the next FEC reporting deadline on June 30th</a>. This goal is everything. And before I ask you to donate to help us hit it—I&#8217;m writing today to tell you why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, our campaign has outperformed at every level:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were a longer than longshot. Then, we were one of the first Democrats to qualify for the debate stage with 65,000 donors.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were just an internet fad, but we started drawing some of the largest crowds in the race.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were a fringe candidate that could never compete in such a crowded field, yet we&#8217;ve cracked 3% polling in NH and SC.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we continue to outperform?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, like our candidate, our team is full of entrepreneurs and operators, and we have a plan.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our plan is to show exponential growth in Q2 and create a dark-horse narrative that shows Andrew can actually win this whole election.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you come in. We need your help to fund this narrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We raised $1.7 million in the first quarter. All from people like you. And with your help, we&#8217;re going to double that to $3.5 million in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we succeed, imagine the headlines:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;2020 candidate Andrew Yang DOUBLES his Q1 fundraising with $3.5M haul”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Political newcomer Andrew Yang raises $3.5M — and threatens to upend 2020 Democratic race”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yang emerges as potential dark horse with $3.5M fundraising haul”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Andrew Yang raises $3.5M in Q2—DOUBLE what he raised in Q1. Could he surprise the field and win the nomination?”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the narrative we must create. We must show we can build the warchest necessary to compete against the top tier—and that we intend to win. That is what we need your help with. We’ve already raised $1,153,862 so far—we have just under $2.4 million more to go before June 30th.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-video"><img title="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/580/attachments/original/ezgif.com-optimize.gif?1558359728" alt="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><strong>My </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>promise</strong></span><strong> to you as campaign manager is that we will do our part and run the most efficient, scrappy, and innovative campaign in election history.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other candidates will raise tens of millions and waste it on bad advertisements and political consultants. Give us $3.5 million this quarter and we will contend.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-link"><strong>In return, my </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ask</strong></span><strong> is that you&#8217;ll help us finance it with any donation you can. And for the next six weeks, make it your top priority to grow and mobilize the Yang Gang to get us there by June 30th.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is the plan. We will not hide from the plan, we will own it, and we even have a new progress bar on the website for the world to see.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-graphic"><img title="Andrew Yang's New Progress Bar" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/580/attachments/original/q2goal-update1-yang2020.jpg?1558366513" alt="Andrew Yang's New Progress Bar" width="100%" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If everyone on this email list donates $20 today, we will hit the goal right away. </span>This is our moment, Yang Gang. <a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-link"><strong>Can you step up today and give $20 to create our dark horse narrative?</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for what you’ve done so far. Our team will be working day and night to reach this goal. Let’s be the dark horse of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach</span></p>
