								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Memorial Day!  I hope you are enjoying a wonderful day with loved ones and family.</p>
<p>Memorial Day became a federal holiday in 1971, though it has been celebrated in some form since the 1860s.  Today, many Americans—especially those who have not experienced personal loss in this arena—have a natural inclination not to look too closely when it comes to the results of the wars we are fighting or have fought.  We are quick with a, &#8220;Thank you for your service.&#8221;  We are slow to think deeply about what it means that <a title="US Military Demographics" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=omAO4PhNPOfhCtXsiaKeG9S9O74ibB7P-_CGI0VNpYsXSMFPKTCoVVv9CTMvv-rSiQFinJkxTsCmdS2mQUBOdw&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=3&amp;test_email=1">less than one percent of our population serves</a>, and that even within our 50 states, <a title="Enlistment Rates by State" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=GUadKUZbNtXpoQtrN7XiLlDAp0T1nvsEvUIUmB084zET-S2kIYZIBXbjoxx2SZQHQqfYORkMeYrZhRQNzRvmSQY3Z9mo89cWnLHvG1N7liAnb9dPmh2LsIQdvaZeVW7Y&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=4&amp;test_email=1">there is a marked difference in enlistment rates</a>, and that <a title="NAMI: Veterans &amp; Active Duty" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=HR0zXZcA2EhSsHwYdNaPOElY_UFTH18Q_a-4zuONy9hwUIJv-xNaxbdZW1dNrIfbdBYe64xW8npcfexw0SuPYQ&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=5&amp;test_email=1">25% of our active duty members and veterans</a> show signs of PTSD and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>To this end, I asked a member of my staff who is a veteran what he would ask of Americans on this Memorial Day.  He recommended an essay that struck a chord with me—<a title="The Warrior at the Mall" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=PiInCVHjZg_Lhb0RQ-dhd-f9dUtA9BFLkPKeNFGdc9IsXFjp9I5xqC5iRDo_w7IeFFUykXMjsG8fSxb2-A_ZQ2DGhEGil4WNRTiB8Hknn0c&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=6&amp;test_email=1">Phil Klay&#8217;s <em>The Warrior at the Mall</em></a>.  The essence of Mr. Klay&#8217;s argument is that, as a result of the same minority of Americans spending decades at war while an overwhelming majority carries on with their lives as if nothing is amiss, a chasm has opened up between civilians and veterans.  This chasm must be bridged, or, as Mr. Klay says:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We risk our country slipping further into the practice of a fraudulent form of American patriotism, where &#8216;soldiers are sacred,&#8217; the work of actual soldiering is ignored and the pageantry of military worship sucks energy away from the obligations of citizenship.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Mr. Klay also points out</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Support for our military remains high at a time when respect for almost every other institution is perilously low, so pushing a military angle as a wedge makes a certain kind of sense.  But &#8230; our military is justified only by the civic life and values it exists to defend.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That is, we don&#8217;t believe in much these days beyond our military.  But the military exists to defend our society itself.</p>
<p>Thus, we owe it to our veterans to take our citizenship seriously enough that it warrants their sacrifices.</p>
<p>If there is a way that we can celebrate this Memorial Day beyond reflecting on and thanking our veterans and members of the armed services for all they have done and given up, it would be to try to become more worthy of their sacrifice.  This includes examining our decisions to put our soldiers into harm&#8217;s way and how we treat and support them after they return.  It even includes how we treat ourselves and other members of our society.</p>
<p>I met with a veterans&#8217; organization this week to learn about their experiences.  Both of the officials I met with served in the Middle East in the Marine Corps.  Now they work at an organization that tries to end the &#8216;Forever Wars&#8217; and advocates for Congress regaining its say on military deployments which have fallen solely to the executive branch since 2001.  That is where their patriotism and service has led them.</p>
<p>We can do better.  We will do better.  For our veterans and the country they sacrificed so much for.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/625/attachments/original/AY_signature.jpg?1558896170" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="136" height="75" /></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, I’ve been running for President for a while.  Our campaign publicly <a title="His 2020 Campaign Message: The Robots Are Coming" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html">launched in February of 2018 in the <em>New York Times</em></a>. Still, most people had never heard of me.  This led to many awkward conversations that went like this:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“So what kind of work do you do?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“I’m running for President of the United States.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“Um, really?  Uh, good luck with that.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“Thanks.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a non-crazy person, this was not a terribly pleasant interaction.  It also tended to derail conversations, we would often just start talking about the campaign.  So in some situations, I would say something vague. “I’m working on a campaign to help manage the impact of technology on the workforce,” or, “I’m an author.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I know, in theory, I should have been telling the milkman about the <a title="FAQ about the Freedom Dividend and UBI" href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/">Freedom Dividend</a>, but sometimes you just want to get the milk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The odds of me getting recognized in public were quite low.  The odds were higher when I was dressed up—wearing a blue suit or blazer with a circular logo on it tends to draw attention.  So does wearing a red, white, and blue scarf.  But when I was just walking around incognito, I was a total non-entity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An example of my relative anonymity—I gave a talk at my son’s school for parents and teachers. Very few people showed up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, most people weren’t paying the slightest bit of attention to 2020 in 2018.  This started to change in 2019.  The awareness level of me and the campaign picked up a great deal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first time I was recognized out on the street in plainclothes, I was taken aback.  I was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.  I figured no one would notice an anonymous Asian man and his son going to the deli.  But the guy in line behind me looked at my face and said, “Hey, are you Andrew Yang?”  I nodded. He was like, “I love you, man!” and asked for a photo.  I said sure, and then felt self-conscious that I looked so off-duty.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another time, a woman came up to me and said, “Are you Andrew Yang?”  And before I could answer, she said, “No, no you’re not,” and walked away.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other day, I counted up 10 times that I was recognized on the street.  Most people are incredibly nice and gracious.  A lot of people will just yell, “Yang Gang!” or, “Good luck!” or, “I support you!”  Many people take their phones out and want a photo, which I’m happy to provide.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, this is fantastic progress.  I am running for President.  Getting recognized is a sign that what we are doing is working.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But I’ll confess that it’s been a bit of an adjustment.  Now, when I walk around, there’s a sense that someone is watching.  I saw someone surreptitiously take a photo of me with my family the other day on their phone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zach said to me, “You’d better get used to it—you’re going to be the leader of the free world.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other day when I got home from campaigning, Evelyn asked me, “How was your trip?”  I said, “It was great!  Thousands of people came to the rally.  Check this out.”  I then pulled up video and photos from the event.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She said, “Wow, that looks huge!  Sometimes I feel like you’re this public figure, and you come home to your alter ego.  Go play with the boys.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I pride myself on being a pretty regular guy.  The plan is to stay human and integrated the whole time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Getting recognized on the street is fun in the context of the campaign.  It will be a small price to pay to accomplish our goals.  I appreciate all of the support we get.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Can someone go from utterly anonymous to President in the space of 2 years?  It’s never been done, but things move very fast in this era, for better or worse.  My encounters on the street suggest that there are a lot of people who like me and the campaign but aren’t yet taking action.  Let’s move them into the action column.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you see me out and about, feel free to grab me and ask for a selfie.  If you say, “I donated to your campaign,” you’ll get a big smile.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for the support!  It means a ton to me and the team.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spent the past weekend in South Carolina and had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of amazing, hard-working Americans.  And, like all Americans, they are worried about the future for their families.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang's First Trip to South Carolina" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/599/attachments/original/south_carolina.jpg?1558532378" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of an auditorium, addressing a large crowd of South Carolinians" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like me, you associate drinking water issues in America with Flint, Michigan.  But that&#8217;s just the most visible of dozens of communities around the country that are struggling with their water supply.  In Denmark, South Carolina, a chemical not approved by the EPA was used for a decade to decontaminate the water, leading to health issues for residents there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine having kids who have been drinking water for years and now knowing that their health might be damaged as a result.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As our infrastructure falls into disrepair and there is less and less money to fix it, these problems will only get worse.  The EPA has estimated that it would cost $384 billion over a ten-year period to properly fix and maintain our water systems.  We live in the wealthiest nation in the world, and we must be able to guarantee clean drinking water for each of our citizens.  When I’m President, we will invest the resources needed to guarantee clean drinking water to all Americans as a basic right.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina recently made national news because the schoolteachers there went on strike for better pay and benefits.  They rank 38<sup>th </sup>nationwide on teacher pay.  Teachers are vital to our future, and when teachers aren’t able to make a decent living, we lose the best of them to other opportunities.  When I’m President, I plan to make sure teachers get paid more—the data shows that a good teacher is worth their weight in gold in terms of driving better educational outcomes for dozens of students each year.  Instead of nickel-and-diming teachers, we should be treating them like professionals and giving them the flexibility to do their jobs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While increasing teacher pay is important, making things better in the classroom is just part of the fight.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Only 25-30% of our kids’ performance in schools is attributable to what happens in school.  The rest of it is due to factors outside of school—parental time and income, number of words read to a child, stress levels, type of neighborhood, etc.  Educators know this.  We are putting them in an impossible situation where we expect them to educate our children, who are distracted by issues at home.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing we can do to set teachers up for success is to get the Freedom Dividend into the hands of all Americans so that our families are stronger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=10"><strong>That’s why I’m running.  Because we need to start putting forward real solutions that will directly improve people’s lives.  I need you to help me make these solutions a reality.  If you can, please donate $10 to our movement.  I genuinely appreciate it.</strong></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Each time I visit a new state, I’m more certain that what we are doing is vital to our nation’s future.  There are so many Americans out there who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s invest in our people, our families, and our communities so that we can build a better future together.  We do not have unlimited time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your grateful candidate,</p>

This goal is everything. And before I ask you to donate to help us hit it—I&#8217;m writing today to tell you why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, our campaign has outperformed at every level:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were a longer than longshot. Then, we were one of the first Democrats to qualify for the debate stage with 65,000 donors.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were just an internet fad, but we started drawing some of the largest crowds in the race.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were a fringe candidate that could never compete in such a crowded field, yet we&#8217;ve cracked 3% polling in NH and SC.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we continue to outperform?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, like our candidate, our team is full of entrepreneurs and operators, and we have a plan.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our plan is to show exponential growth in Q2 and create a dark-horse narrative that shows Andrew can actually win this whole election.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you come in. We need your help to fund this narrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We raised $1.7 million in the first quarter. All from people like you. And with your help, we&#8217;re going to double that to $3.5 million in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we succeed, imagine the headlines:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;2020 candidate Andrew Yang DOUBLES his Q1 fundraising with $3.5M haul”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Political newcomer Andrew Yang raises $3.5M — and threatens to upend 2020 Democratic race”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yang emerges as potential dark horse with $3.5M fundraising haul”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Andrew Yang raises $3.5M in Q2—DOUBLE what he raised in Q1. Could he surprise the field and win the nomination?”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the narrative we must create. We must show we can build the warchest necessary to compete against the top tier—and that we intend to win. That is what we need your help with. We’ve already raised $1,153,862 so far—we have just under $2.4 million more to go before June 30th.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-video"><img title="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/580/attachments/original/ezgif.com-optimize.gif?1558359728" alt="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><strong>My </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>promise</strong></span><strong> to you as campaign manager is that we will do our part and run the most efficient, scrappy, and innovative campaign in election history.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other candidates will raise tens of millions and waste it on bad advertisements and political consultants. Give us $3.5 million this quarter and we will contend.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-link"><strong>In return, my </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ask</strong></span><strong> is that you&#8217;ll help us finance it with any donation you can. And for the next six weeks, make it your top priority to grow and mobilize the Yang Gang to get us there by June 30th.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is the plan. We will not hide from the plan, we will own it, and we even have a new progress bar on the website for the world to see.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-graphic"><img title="Andrew Yang's New Progress Bar" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/580/attachments/original/q2goal-update1-yang2020.jpg?1558366513" alt="Andrew Yang's New Progress Bar" width="100%" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If everyone on this email list donates $20 today, we will hit the goal right away. </span>This is our moment, Yang Gang. <a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-link"><strong>Can you step up today and give $20 to create our dark horse narrative?</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for what you’ve done so far. Our team will be working day and night to reach this goal. Let’s be the dark horse of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, we held our long-anticipated outdoor rally in Washington Square Park in New York.  Our team had been planning this event for weeks in advance.  We were working around the clock to make it a success.  Then, we woke up Tuesday morning to find it was going to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We became worried that nobody would show up—but instead, when I arrived at the rally site, there were nearly 3,000 supporters gathered in the pouring rain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="The Crowd at Andrew Yang's Washington Square Park Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed_15.jpg?1557960557" alt="A field of umbrellas stretches across Washington Square Park - supporters waiting to hear Andrew Yang speak" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I realized we never should have doubted.  The Yang Gang is energized and ready to win this election.  A little rain won’t stop us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the rain had an upside: it shocked the reporters who were covering the rally in the media tent in the back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reporter even told my staff that he could not believe our massive turnout.  His exact words? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of this makes any sense!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Washington Square Park" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed-9.jpg?1557958675" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of a crowd in Washington Square Park, delivering a speech as the rain falls" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media is just catching on to what all of us have known for a long time now.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win this whole election and implement the Freedom Dividend to guarantee $1,000 per month for all Americans.  We can change this country and build a human-centered economy for all. </span></p>
<p><strong>We are drawing some of the largest crowds in the race and polling at 3% when most Americans have never heard of me.  </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the next few months, we are going to build on our momentum by hiring organizers in the critical early states, expanding our social media presence, and getting coverage in major national press outlets.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>But to achieve all those things, we need to be focused on one major goal between now and the FEC reporting deadline at the end of June—we need to raise $3.5 million.  Click here to contribute and help us reach our new goal.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it’s a pretty big number, but if we can meet this goal, we will DOUBLE our numbers from last quarter.  Imagine if we make it.  Think about turning on CNN and seeing their reports that our fundraising numbers in July have captured the attention of the country. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>So I’m asking you today—chip in to help us raise $3.5M by the end of June.</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If everyone on this list donates $20, we will hit our goal instantly.  That is the MATH.  With your help, we make the case that we are the candidate to beat in 2020.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and hope you had a wonderful Mother’s Day weekend!  I spent it with both Evelyn and my mom.  We should all call our moms more often.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I was back in New Hampshire for our best trip yet.  At each stop, I talked about going to high school in New Hampshire and my path from my high school days to running for President.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We got our biggest crowds yet:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang in New Hampshire" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/543/attachments/original/190511_New_Hampshire_rally.jpg?1557765875" alt="Andrew Yang is surrounded by supporters after a rally in New Hampshire" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang Addresses New Hampshirites" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/543/attachments/original/190511_New_Hampshire_church.jpg?1557763222" alt="Andrew Yang addresses supporters in New Hampshire" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And people noticed.  The events were written up in <a title="Yang starts to attract attention in NH" href="https://www.wmur.com/article/yang-starts-to-attract-attention-in-nh/27425380">Manchester</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang pitches ‘trickle up’ economy" href="https://www.seacoastonline.com/news/20190510/andrew-yang-pitches-trickle-up-economy">Seacoast Online</a>, <a title="Yang touts his 'tech check' at town hall event in Hollis" href="https://www.unionleader.com/news/politics/national/yang-touts-his-tech-check-at-town-hall-event-in/article_b06e6bf2-b9d7-5c9b-9b12-4591ddd430be.html">Union Leader</a>, and other New Hampshire publications, as well as <a title="How Andrew Yang's Online Following Has Turned Into a Real-Life Coalition" href="http://time.com/5587792/andrew-yang-presidential-candidate/">TIME</a>, <a title="Once seen as extreme 2020 long shot, Yang is attracting some buzz" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/once-seen-as-extreme-2020-long-shot-yang-is-attracting-some-buzz">Fox</a>, and <a title="Is Andrew Yang ‘Too Nice’ to Beat President Trump?" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/andrew-yang-2020-president.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.  Among the descriptions:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Progressive, inclusive, and incredibly creative and smart.  His enthusiasm is not divisive &#8230; Yang is one to watch.”  </em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>“Lightning in a bottle.”</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He&#8217;s my front-runner.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;Yang has his eyes on the future.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He&#8217;s the first political candidate to actually get [many people] excited.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;[His campaign is] actually listening to people, taking people seriously, thoughtfully and in an analytical way.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;"><em>&#8220;He’s outside the box in a way that, whew, really charged, really evoked amazing insight.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We also got a mention on Bill Maher as someone on the rise.  I’m scheduled to go on Bill Maher in early June.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everywhere we went in New Hampshire, we were met with growing crowds and excitement.  I credit Steve Marchand for much of the buzz.  Steve ran for governor as a Democrat in 2018 and has now endorsed me. I haven’t been that big a fan of seeking political endorsements—I’m not sure how much they matter to voters, particularly the folks who have embraced our campaign.  But in Steve’s case, it is more personal than that; so many people like and admire him as someone they have worked with.  At every stop, people greeted him with hugs and smiles.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Steve and our NH State Director, Khrystina Snell, have deep relationships all over the state.  They will get us in front of the right people on every visit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I have never felt better about our trajectory in New Hampshire.  This trip was electric.  We will contend and shock the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This week, we are gearing up for our <a title="Andrew Yang's Humanity First Rally in NYC" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-new-york-city-tickets-60545100024">biggest rally yet in New York City</a> on Tuesday—ABC and many other major news outlets will be there, and 5,000 supporters have RSVPed.  It is going to be epic.  And then it’s on to <a title="Events Page with South Carolina Events Listed" href="https://www.yang2020.com/events/">our first visit to South Carolina</a> where we are presently <a title="‘The safe choice:’ Biden widens SC lead in 2020 Democratic presidential primary" href="https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/the-safe-choice-biden-widens-sc-lead-in-democratic-presidential/article_f727895c-731f-11e9-888a-af4280777b2a.html">polling at 2%</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your belief in me and the campaign have made all of this possible.  Thank you.  If you can make a donation today, please do so—we have the chance to make history.  Let’s make the most of it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your charged up candidate,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">We were in Des Moines the other day wrapping up a town hall.  It was Zach, Carly, Luke, and I.  It was raining and chilly.  Our white Chevy Suburban was parked far across the parking lot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at each other for a second.  Were we all going to go to the car in the rain?  Or was someone going to run to the car and drive it over for the rest of us?</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zach quickly said, “I’ll run out and get the car,” and then dashed into the rain while the rest of us waited.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After he pulled up, we piled in.  Carly said, “That was such a dad move, Zach.”  It’s true.  That’s the sort of thing I do with my family all of the time.  I go and get the car in harsh elements while they wait under shelter.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So then I said, “Wait a minute.  If Zach is the Dad of this family, what am I?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Zach and Andrew Share a Bite to Eat" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/519/attachments/original/Image_from_iOS.jpg?1557330020" alt="Zach sits in the driver's seat eating food with Andrew" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">And then it dawned on me—I&#8217;m the baby.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I realized a bunch of things very quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">People are taking care of me all of the time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Staffers have my favorite foods around.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">If I get in a bad mood, everyone around me suffers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">My schedule determines everyone else’s.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Others are grooming me, sometimes several times a day.</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The parallels were eerie.  Zach is the patient Dad.  Carly, the energetic sister.  Luke is the quiet son.  And I am the kid around which the world revolves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is hard to understand how close you get on the campaign trail.  You literally wake up together in an Airbnb, eat together, ride together in a car for hours on end, and coordinate every part of your day.  It is very intense.  You are in tight proximity to each other for hours and hours.  I’ve noticed that some other candidates travel with actual family members for this reason.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m glad to say that the team and I enjoy our time on the road, even when it gets tiring.  We get along famously.  Good thing, because we travel a lot.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m incredibly grateful to the people on the campaign team.  Most joined before I had any level of public recognition.  They saw something in me and my ideas.  Many took huge pay cuts because they saw the chance to have a huge impact.  Their talent level and idealism are both sky high.  This campaign attracts amazing people.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m accustomed to being the father figure—the CEO of a business, the head of a non-profit, and, of course, being an actual dad.  I hope to be the leader of a revolution that transforms the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But there are many times on the campaign where I’m the person being taken care of instead of the opposite.  And I’m grateful for it.  Let someone else run into the rain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;re heading throughout New Hampshire to <a title="Andrew Yang Dartmouth Town Hall" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-at-dartmouth-tickets-60974555537">Hanover</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang and the Upper Valley Democrats" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/yang-in-the-upper-valley-nh-tickets-61004211238">Lebanon</a>, <a title="Meet &amp; Greet with Andrew Yang in Concord" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/coffee-with-andrew-yang-tickets-61115505121">Concord</a>, <a title="Humanity First Rally in Portsmouth" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-portsmouth-nh-tickets-61004410835">Portsmouth</a>, <a title="Andrew Yang and the Sullivan County Democrats" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-claremont-nh-tickets-61004641525">Claremont</a>, <a title="Town Hall with Andrew Yang in Hollis" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/town-hall-with-andrew-yang-tickets-61050374313">Hollis</a>, <a title="Meet &amp; Greet with Andrew Yang in Windham" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-windham-nh-tickets-61114022687">Windham</a>, and <a title="Pot Luck Supper with Andrew Yang in Milford" href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/andrew-yang-in-milford-nh-tickets-61044854804">Milford</a>. If you can make it, or have a friend in the area, please do come or let them know.  We will be traveling with Steve Marchand, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in New Hampshire who just endorsed me.  His endorsement made the nightly <a title="Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Steve Marchand endorses Andrew Yang" href="https://www.wmur.com/article/former-democratic-gubernatorial-candidate-steve-marchand-endorses-andrew-yang/27172864"><u>news</u> in New Hampshire</a> and <a title="We’ve updated our N.H. primary rankings and there’s a new front-runner" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/new-hampshire/2019/05/03/updated-our-primary-rankings-and-there-new-frontrunner/cTA3STmZQoApt4jUbtpJdI/story.html">the Boston Globe</a> and has made waves throughout the state.  Thanks to Steve, we are growing in New Hampshire very quickly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Here&#8217;s to a growing family,</p>
