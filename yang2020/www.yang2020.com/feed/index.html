								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thank you all for your continued support!  Without you, this campaign wouldn’t be here.  As it is, we are at #9 in the latest CNN rankings and climbing fast. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>I’m spending this last weekend before the debate in South Carolina, one of the early primary states.  We are at 3% here.  This is my second trip to the state, and I’m excited to get to meet even more voters here.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I spent time meeting with local press and politicians before heading to a Fish Fry hosted by Representative Jim Clyburn.  Almost all the other candidates were there, so it was a great warm-up for next week. I must say that every time I share the stage with the other candidates, I feel more relaxed and ready for the debates.</p>
<p><img title="Andrew Yang at South Carolina Fish Fry" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/798/attachments/original/190622_South_Carolina_email-3.jpg?1561212361" alt="Andrew Yang delivers a speech on the stage of Rep. Clyburn's Fish Fry in South Carolina" width="100%" /></p>
<p>On stage, I talked about the biggest problems facing the country, but there are also many other local and national issues I didn&#8217;t have a chance to talk about.  South Carolina is one of many states to see their teachers strike or protest.  I can’t say I blame them.  We expect teachers to work miracles in the classroom, when studies show that up to 70% of a student’s outcomes are related to non-school factors.  We also know that teacher quality is one of the most important factors determining student outcomes within a school, and yet we don’t pay teachers nearly enough.</p>
<p>When I’m President, we’ll be sure to give teachers a raise and invest in programs that will improve quality, such as mentorship and professional development programs.  And, of course, the Freedom Dividend will reduce financial stress across America, freeing our children up to stop worrying at home and start learning at school.</p>
<p>Another policy the teachers were promoting is increasing investment in mental health in schools.  Every school should have a mental health professional.  We’re in a mental health crisis right now, especially among teens.  We need to invest the resources to make sure that our children are healthy during their adolescence.</p>
<p>We are beyond excited for the week to come.  I&#8217;ll be on the Colbert Show on Monday night with a special announcement.  And then it will be off to Miami for the debates!  History has opened a door for us &#8211; let&#8217;s take full advantage and establish a more positive direction for the country.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been running for President for over a year now, and I&#8217;ve become even more convinced that moneyed interests have captured our democratic system.  Especially since the decision in <em>Citizens United</em>, the amount of money that it takes to run a campaign is ridiculous, and it ensures that the rich will have both an easier time running for office and a direct line to politicians who rely on their donations to win elections.</p>
<p>Almost all politicians complain about needing to spend hours every day on &#8220;call time&#8221; &#8211; sitting there, reaching out to wealthy donors and pleading for their support.  Why is this something we accept?  Aren&#8217;t our leaders supposed to spend their time fixing our problems, not catering to the whims of the wealthiest?  This is a primary reason our politics has become so broken, and we have to fix it.</p>
<p>I also believe that the way we vote has resulted in a system that no longer works for most Americans.  Two of the past five elections have been won by the candidate with fewer votes.  Third-party candidates frequently bring important considerations and voices to the political process, but they&#8217;re drowned out by the two major parties, and &#8211; fair or not &#8211; are usually called spoilers by the losing party.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m for overturning <em>Citizens United</em> and reforming (though not eliminating) the electoral college, but those would require constitutional amendments.  That process would take too long considering our democracy is breaking down now.  We need to focus on solutions to these problems today, and we can do that through reforms to the way campaigns are funded and the way Americans vote.</p>
<p><a title="Restore Democracy" href="https://my.yang2020.com/restore_democracy?e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=060519_democracy_petition_3&amp;n=2&amp;test_email=1">If you agree that we need to get money out of politics, and change the way we vote, sign the petition here!</a></p>
<p>Reform #1 &#8211; Democracy Dollars</p>
<p>The easiest way to minimize the influence of super-rich individuals and SuperPACs in our politics is to drown that money out with contributions by normal Americans.  Under my Democracy Dollars plan, every American would receive $100 per election cycle to donate to candidates of their choosing.  This would amount to a potential $20 billion+ a year, much higher than the amount spent by these moneyed interests if even a small proportion of Americans utilize them.</p>
<p>It would also save our leaders from spending hours every day calling and begging for money.  That&#8217;s time that would be better spent looking out for the interests of the people they represent, and it would keep them human, as making those calls is soul-crushing.</p>
<p>Reform #2 &#8211; Ranked Choice Voting</p>
<p>A democracy requires the people to feel that their elected officials represent them.  Our current, one-round voting system frequently results in that not happening.  People feel they can&#8217;t vote for a third-party candidate they prefer, and they often vote strategically instead of for their favorite candidate.  In primaries, this often leads to more extreme candidates because centrists lose out to the wings of the party that don&#8217;t represent the average voter.</p>
<p>If we move to a ranked choice voting system, we&#8217;ll end up with candidates that better represent the preferences of voters.  It would reward candidates with broad support, and some studies show it decreases negative campaigning.  It would also break up the two-party duopoly that currently dominates our elections.</p>
<p>There are many other reforms I&#8217;m proposing to address many other problems with our democracy &#8211; you can read about them below.  But, to me, diminishing the influence of those with the largest amount of money, and reforming our first-past-the-post voting system, will do the most good in the shortest time.</p>
<p><a title="Restore Democracy Petition" href="https://my.yang2020.com/restore_democracy?e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=060519_democracy_petition_3&amp;n=3&amp;test_email=1">Please sign this petition to show your support for these pro-democracy reforms!</a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year marks the 50th Anniversary of the Stonewall Riots. In some ways, we as a country have made great strides in providing equal rights to LGBTQ+ individuals, highlighted by the decision in Obergefell in 2015. That Supreme Court decision had a tangible, positive impact on the lives of millions of Americans who were looking to receive equal recognition from their government for their families.</p>
<p>However, we can do a lot better at implementing policies that would make a difference in the lives of LGBTQ+ Americans. This is one of the reasons I think the Freedom Dividend of $1,000 a month is the best policy for advancing our country.</p>
<p>A recent survey of LGBTQ+ individuals between the ages of 18 and 25 found that 1 out of 10 had experienced homelessness within the previous 12 months. This is driven in large part by losing support from their families simply for being who they are. The Freedom Dividend would provide these individuals with resources in order to start building their lives by moving to a new area or finding housing.</p>
<p>Additionally, passing a Medicare for All law with strong protections and coverage for all Americans would be especially beneficial to the LGBTQ+ community. This group often faces issues getting health insurance, or receiving treatment without facing discrimination. This is especially true for mental health issues, which are faced at triple the rate seen in the rest of the population. Under my presidency, everyone would have access to quality care that would address all issues without judgment or discrimination.</p>
<p>Everyone would also be free to serve in the military during my administration. Many generals and admirals agree that the current administration&#8217;s ban on transgender military service harms combat effectiveness and compromises the military&#8217;s values. I would be honored and humbled to serve as Commander in Chief to any patriot who is willing to sacrifice everything in order to protect our country.</p>
<p>Every American should be free to live the life that they want to live, without fear of homelessness, or being denied quality medical care, or being denied the honor of serving in our military. We can do better for LGBTQ+ Americans and all Americans.</p>
<p>We are all human, love is love, and people are people.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello all and thank you for your support!  I hope you had a wonderful holiday weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a busy week in the press for our campaign.  In addition to the recent <a title="Is Andrew Yang for Real?" href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2019/05/20/andrew-yang-2020-226931">Politico profile</a> and <a title="ActBlue CNN Page" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/cnnrankings">CNN putting me in its top 10</a>, </span><a href="http://time.com/longform/andrew-yang-2020-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME did a profile on my campaign</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> and <a title="Andrew Yang Wants To Give You $1,000 A Month (HBO)" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mK5pWtlDVFk">VICE News also did a story on me</a>, which you can watch on HBO.  It’s a great reason to keep your subscription post-Game of Thrones.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang Profile in TIME" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/650/attachments/original/Screen_Shot_2019-05-30_at_9.24.28_AM.png?1559222758" alt="Andrew Yang cover story on TIME Magazine" width="100%" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted to share a story with you from a supporter.  I believe it is stories like this one that are the reason we are seeing our campaign grow at such a rapid pace:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am 51 years old and have never voted. Me and my husband only receive $520 each per month on SSI and only $89 in SNAP. We have two twin sons that live with us. We recently moved into a home that was rented to us by someone who didn&#8217;t own the property. Now we are being forced out on the streets by the owner. But I am a fighter and will continue to do what I need for my family, I never met any candidate that was as honest and caring for people as I have seen in Andrew Yang and know from the bottom of my heart that he is the one that we need as President. We may not have much, but I try to donate as much as I can to help get him in the office. I know that Yang is our only hope for our future. I have committed myself to do whatever I can to get Andrew Yang to be our next President.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This campaign is doing so well because we are the only campaign talking about the big problems facing us as our economy transforms underneath our feet.  We are talking about a future where families do not have to feel stuck in place or hopeless.  They do not have to live with an economic boot on their necks. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our success is also because we are powered by YOU—our average donation is only around $22 per person.  We don’t take any corporate PAC money. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are slowly moving up in the polls and name recognition but we still have a long way to go. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=5?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=Organic&amp;utm_campaign=astory&amp;utm_term=&amp;utm_content=190530LinkTop"><strong>Make a $5 contribution today and not only can we compete in states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina, but we can take our message all the way to Washington when we win this entire election.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While other politicians in the field are offering 20th century solutions to 21st century problems, we know the reality.  Automation is threatening over 20-30% of all American jobs in the next 11 years, and 90%+ of jobs created in the past decade are temporary, gig, or contract jobs, with no benefits or security.  Our government is dangerously behind the curve at dealing with emerging technologies and their impact on our way of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are taking a bold and innovative approach to the way we want to fix the problems facing this country, and I could not be more proud of the way we are doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have another story I want you to read—because it is the future of many American workers whether they realize it yet or not:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m a college educated, 40+, single, underpaid admin worker living in Seattle. My skill set will eventually become automated, and I have no real means or desire to get a graduate degree at this point to compete with younger generations, and I don&#8217;t want the debt of school weighing on me. I see the donations as an investment in my future; it feels pretty bleak otherwise. As someone who feels largely ignored by other candidates, I&#8217;m supporting Andrew Yang, whose Freedom Dividend will help everyone.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we started this race, we were called a ‘longer-than-long-shot’ campaign.  Well, this longer-than-long-shot has qualified for the first Democratic debates in June and July and is on pace to qualify for the Fall debates while sitting Representatives and Senators are still struggling to find their place on stage. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s safe to say we’re competing.  And it’s all because of you.  It’s why my name recognition is increasing in early primary states.  It’s why the media is finally paying attention.  It’s why we are going to qualify for the debates and why we are going to continue talking about the issues that politicians are too afraid to talk about. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win in 2020.  But we have to push to make sure it happens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With your help, we can make the case for a new vision for our country and take it all the way to the White House in 2020.</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happy Memorial Day!  I hope you are enjoying a wonderful day with loved ones and family.</p>
<p>Memorial Day became a federal holiday in 1971, though it has been celebrated in some form since the 1860s.  Today, many Americans—especially those who have not experienced personal loss in this arena—have a natural inclination not to look too closely when it comes to the results of the wars we are fighting or have fought.  We are quick with a, &#8220;Thank you for your service.&#8221;  We are slow to think deeply about what it means that <a title="US Military Demographics" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=omAO4PhNPOfhCtXsiaKeG9S9O74ibB7P-_CGI0VNpYsXSMFPKTCoVVv9CTMvv-rSiQFinJkxTsCmdS2mQUBOdw&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=3&amp;test_email=1">less than one percent of our population serves</a>, and that even within our 50 states, <a title="Enlistment Rates by State" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=GUadKUZbNtXpoQtrN7XiLlDAp0T1nvsEvUIUmB084zET-S2kIYZIBXbjoxx2SZQHQqfYORkMeYrZhRQNzRvmSQY3Z9mo89cWnLHvG1N7liAnb9dPmh2LsIQdvaZeVW7Y&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=4&amp;test_email=1">there is a marked difference in enlistment rates</a>, and that <a title="NAMI: Veterans &amp; Active Duty" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=HR0zXZcA2EhSsHwYdNaPOElY_UFTH18Q_a-4zuONy9hwUIJv-xNaxbdZW1dNrIfbdBYe64xW8npcfexw0SuPYQ&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=5&amp;test_email=1">25% of our active duty members and veterans</a> show signs of PTSD and other mental health issues.</p>
<p>To this end, I asked a member of my staff who is a veteran what he would ask of Americans on this Memorial Day.  He recommended an essay that struck a chord with me—<a title="The Warrior at the Mall" href="https://my.yang2020.com/r?u=PiInCVHjZg_Lhb0RQ-dhd-f9dUtA9BFLkPKeNFGdc9IsXFjp9I5xqC5iRDo_w7IeFFUykXMjsG8fSxb2-A_ZQ2DGhEGil4WNRTiB8Hknn0c&amp;e=c298f81ae559614d1b4a31d397a596e6&amp;utm_source=yang2020&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=05272019_mem_day_2&amp;n=6&amp;test_email=1">Phil Klay&#8217;s <em>The Warrior at the Mall</em></a>.  The essence of Mr. Klay&#8217;s argument is that, as a result of the same minority of Americans spending decades at war while an overwhelming majority carries on with their lives as if nothing is amiss, a chasm has opened up between civilians and veterans.  This chasm must be bridged, or, as Mr. Klay says:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;We risk our country slipping further into the practice of a fraudulent form of American patriotism, where &#8216;soldiers are sacred,&#8217; the work of actual soldiering is ignored and the pageantry of military worship sucks energy away from the obligations of citizenship.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Mr. Klay also points out</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Support for our military remains high at a time when respect for almost every other institution is perilously low, so pushing a military angle as a wedge makes a certain kind of sense.  But &#8230; our military is justified only by the civic life and values it exists to defend.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That is, we don&#8217;t believe in much these days beyond our military.  But the military exists to defend our society itself.</p>
<p>Thus, we owe it to our veterans to take our citizenship seriously enough that it warrants their sacrifices.</p>
<p>If there is a way that we can celebrate this Memorial Day beyond reflecting on and thanking our veterans and members of the armed services for all they have done and given up, it would be to try to become more worthy of their sacrifice.  This includes examining our decisions to put our soldiers into harm&#8217;s way and how we treat and support them after they return.  It even includes how we treat ourselves and other members of our society.</p>
<p>I met with a veterans&#8217; organization this week to learn about their experiences.  Both of the officials I met with served in the Middle East in the Marine Corps.  Now they work at an organization that tries to end the &#8216;Forever Wars&#8217; and advocates for Congress regaining its say on military deployments which have fallen solely to the executive branch since 2001.  That is where their patriotism and service has led them.</p>
<p>We can do better.  We will do better.  For our veterans and the country they sacrificed so much for.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p><img title="Andrew Yang's Signature" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/625/attachments/original/AY_signature.jpg?1558896170" alt="Andrew Yang's Signature" width="136" height="75" /></p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, I’ve been running for President for a while.  Our campaign publicly <a title="His 2020 Campaign Message: The Robots Are Coming" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/10/technology/his-2020-campaign-message-the-robots-are-coming.html">launched in February of 2018 in the <em>New York Times</em></a>. Still, most people had never heard of me.  This led to many awkward conversations that went like this:</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“So what kind of work do you do?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“I’m running for President of the United States.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“Um, really?  Uh, good luck with that.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; padding-left: 30px;">“Thanks.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a non-crazy person, this was not a terribly pleasant interaction.  It also tended to derail conversations, we would often just start talking about the campaign.  So in some situations, I would say something vague. “I’m working on a campaign to help manage the impact of technology on the workforce,” or, “I’m an author.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I know, in theory, I should have been telling the milkman about the <a title="FAQ about the Freedom Dividend and UBI" href="https://www.yang2020.com/what-is-ubi/">Freedom Dividend</a>, but sometimes you just want to get the milk.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The odds of me getting recognized in public were quite low.  The odds were higher when I was dressed up—wearing a blue suit or blazer with a circular logo on it tends to draw attention.  So does wearing a red, white, and blue scarf.  But when I was just walking around incognito, I was a total non-entity.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An example of my relative anonymity—I gave a talk at my son’s school for parents and teachers. Very few people showed up.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, most people weren’t paying the slightest bit of attention to 2020 in 2018.  This started to change in 2019.  The awareness level of me and the campaign picked up a great deal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The first time I was recognized out on the street in plainclothes, I was taken aback.  I was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.  I figured no one would notice an anonymous Asian man and his son going to the deli.  But the guy in line behind me looked at my face and said, “Hey, are you Andrew Yang?”  I nodded. He was like, “I love you, man!” and asked for a photo.  I said sure, and then felt self-conscious that I looked so off-duty.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another time, a woman came up to me and said, “Are you Andrew Yang?”  And before I could answer, she said, “No, no you’re not,” and walked away.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other day, I counted up 10 times that I was recognized on the street.  Most people are incredibly nice and gracious.  A lot of people will just yell, “Yang Gang!” or, “Good luck!” or, “I support you!”  Many people take their phones out and want a photo, which I’m happy to provide.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, this is fantastic progress.  I am running for President.  Getting recognized is a sign that what we are doing is working.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">But I’ll confess that it’s been a bit of an adjustment.  Now, when I walk around, there’s a sense that someone is watching.  I saw someone surreptitiously take a photo of me with my family the other day on their phone.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Zach said to me, “You’d better get used to it—you’re going to be the leader of the free world.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The other day when I got home from campaigning, Evelyn asked me, “How was your trip?”  I said, “It was great!  Thousands of people came to the rally.  Check this out.”  I then pulled up video and photos from the event.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">She said, “Wow, that looks huge!  Sometimes I feel like you’re this public figure, and you come home to your alter ego.  Go play with the boys.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I pride myself on being a pretty regular guy.  The plan is to stay human and integrated the whole time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Getting recognized on the street is fun in the context of the campaign.  It will be a small price to pay to accomplish our goals.  I appreciate all of the support we get.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Can someone go from utterly anonymous to President in the space of 2 years?  It’s never been done, but things move very fast in this era, for better or worse.  My encounters on the street suggest that there are a lot of people who like me and the campaign but aren’t yet taking action.  Let’s move them into the action column.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you see me out and about, feel free to grab me and ask for a selfie.  If you say, “I donated to your campaign,” you’ll get a big smile.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and thank you for the support!  It means a ton to me and the team.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I spent the past weekend in South Carolina and had the opportunity to meet with hundreds of amazing, hard-working Americans.  And, like all Americans, they are worried about the future for their families.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400; text-align: center;"><img title="Andrew Yang's First Trip to South Carolina" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/599/attachments/original/south_carolina.jpg?1558532378" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of an auditorium, addressing a large crowd of South Carolinians" width="100%" /></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re like me, you associate drinking water issues in America with Flint, Michigan.  But that&#8217;s just the most visible of dozens of communities around the country that are struggling with their water supply.  In Denmark, South Carolina, a chemical not approved by the EPA was used for a decade to decontaminate the water, leading to health issues for residents there.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine having kids who have been drinking water for years and now knowing that their health might be damaged as a result.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As our infrastructure falls into disrepair and there is less and less money to fix it, these problems will only get worse.  The EPA has estimated that it would cost $384 billion over a ten-year period to properly fix and maintain our water systems.  We live in the wealthiest nation in the world, and we must be able to guarantee clean drinking water for each of our citizens.  When I’m President, we will invest the resources needed to guarantee clean drinking water to all Americans as a basic right.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">South Carolina recently made national news because the schoolteachers there went on strike for better pay and benefits.  They rank 38<sup>th </sup>nationwide on teacher pay.  Teachers are vital to our future, and when teachers aren’t able to make a decent living, we lose the best of them to other opportunities.  When I’m President, I plan to make sure teachers get paid more—the data shows that a good teacher is worth their weight in gold in terms of driving better educational outcomes for dozens of students each year.  Instead of nickel-and-diming teachers, we should be treating them like professionals and giving them the flexibility to do their jobs.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">While increasing teacher pay is important, making things better in the classroom is just part of the fight.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Only 25-30% of our kids’ performance in schools is attributable to what happens in school.  The rest of it is due to factors outside of school—parental time and income, number of words read to a child, stress levels, type of neighborhood, etc.  Educators know this.  We are putting them in an impossible situation where we expect them to educate our children, who are distracted by issues at home.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest thing we can do to set teachers up for success is to get the Freedom Dividend into the hands of all Americans so that our families are stronger.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/friends-of-andrew-yang?amount=10"><strong>That’s why I’m running.  Because we need to start putting forward real solutions that will directly improve people’s lives.  I need you to help me make these solutions a reality.  If you can, please donate $10 to our movement.  I genuinely appreciate it.</strong></a></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Each time I visit a new state, I’m more certain that what we are doing is vital to our nation’s future.  There are so many Americans out there who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s invest in our people, our families, and our communities so that we can build a better future together.  We do not have unlimited time.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Your grateful candidate,</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is Zach Graumann, Andrew&#8217;s campaign manager. I&#8217;ve been working with Andrew since the early days when we operated out of an apartment. We knew we had a real shot to win this election then. Today, thanks to you, we’re more confident than ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, Andrew emailed you about <a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-linktop">our new goal of raising $3.5 million by the next FEC reporting deadline on June 30th</a>. This goal is everything. And before I ask you to donate to help us hit it—I&#8217;m writing today to tell you why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To date, our campaign has outperformed at every level:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were a longer than longshot. Then, we were one of the first Democrats to qualify for the debate stage with 65,000 donors.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were just an internet fad, but we started drawing some of the largest crowds in the race.</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">They told us we were a fringe candidate that could never compete in such a crowded field, yet we&#8217;ve cracked 3% polling in NH and SC.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we continue to outperform?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, like our candidate, our team is full of entrepreneurs and operators, and we have a plan.</span></p>
<p><strong>Our plan is to show exponential growth in Q2 and create a dark-horse narrative that shows Andrew can actually win this whole election.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is where you come in. We need your help to fund this narrative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We raised $1.7 million in the first quarter. All from people like you. And with your help, we&#8217;re going to double that to $3.5 million in the second quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we succeed, imagine the headlines:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;2020 candidate Andrew Yang DOUBLES his Q1 fundraising with $3.5M haul”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Political newcomer Andrew Yang raises $3.5M — and threatens to upend 2020 Democratic race”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yang emerges as potential dark horse with $3.5M fundraising haul”</span></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Andrew Yang raises $3.5M in Q2—DOUBLE what he raised in Q1. Could he surprise the field and win the nomination?”</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That is the narrative we must create. We must show we can build the warchest necessary to compete against the top tier—and that we intend to win. That is what we need your help with. We’ve already raised $1,153,862 so far—we have just under $2.4 million more to go before June 30th.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-video"><img title="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/580/attachments/original/ezgif.com-optimize.gif?1558359728" alt="Our New Goal: Raise $3.5M by June 30th" width="100%" /></a></p>
<p><strong>My </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>promise</strong></span><strong> to you as campaign manager is that we will do our part and run the most efficient, scrappy, and innovative campaign in election history.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Other candidates will raise tens of millions and waste it on bad advertisements and political consultants. Give us $3.5 million this quarter and we will contend.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-link"><strong>In return, my </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ask</strong></span><strong> is that you&#8217;ll help us finance it with any donation you can. And for the next six weeks, make it your top priority to grow and mobilize the Yang Gang to get us there by June 30th.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So this is the plan. We will not hide from the plan, we will own it, and we even have a new progress bar on the website for the world to see.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-graphic"><img title="Andrew Yang's New Progress Bar" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/580/attachments/original/q2goal-update1-yang2020.jpg?1558366513" alt="Andrew Yang's New Progress Bar" width="100%" /></a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If everyone on this email list donates $20 today, we will hit the goal right away. </span>This is our moment, Yang Gang. <a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/520goal-link"><strong>Can you step up today and give $20 to create our dark horse narrative?</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you all for what you’ve done so far. Our team will be working day and night to reach this goal. Let’s be the dark horse of 2020.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Humanity First,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zach</span></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday night, we held our long-anticipated outdoor rally in Washington Square Park in New York.  Our team had been planning this event for weeks in advance.  We were working around the clock to make it a success.  Then, we woke up Tuesday morning to find it was going to rain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We became worried that nobody would show up—but instead, when I arrived at the rally site, there were nearly 3,000 supporters gathered in the pouring rain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="The Crowd at Andrew Yang's Washington Square Park Rally" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed_15.jpg?1557960557" alt="A field of umbrellas stretches across Washington Square Park - supporters waiting to hear Andrew Yang speak" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that moment, I realized we never should have doubted.  The Yang Gang is energized and ready to win this election.  A little rain won’t stop us. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, the rain had an upside: it shocked the reporters who were covering the rally in the media tent in the back. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reporter even told my staff that he could not believe our massive turnout.  His exact words? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“None of this makes any sense!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img title="Andrew Yang in Washington Square Park" src="https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/yang2020/mailings/569/attachments/original/190514_new_york_compressed-9.jpg?1557958675" alt="Andrew Yang stands in front of a crowd in Washington Square Park, delivering a speech as the rain falls" width="100%" /></span></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media is just catching on to what all of us have known for a long time now.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can win this whole election and implement the Freedom Dividend to guarantee $1,000 per month for all Americans.  We can change this country and build a human-centered economy for all. </span></p>
<p><strong>We are drawing some of the largest crowds in the race and polling at 3% when most Americans have never heard of me.  </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in the next few months, we are going to build on our momentum by hiring organizers in the critical early states, expanding our social media presence, and getting coverage in major national press outlets.</span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>But to achieve all those things, we need to be focused on one major goal between now and the FEC reporting deadline at the end of June—we need to raise $3.5 million.  Click here to contribute and help us reach our new goal.</strong></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know, it’s a pretty big number, but if we can meet this goal, we will DOUBLE our numbers from last quarter.  Imagine if we make it.  Think about turning on CNN and seeing their reports that our fundraising numbers in July have captured the attention of the country. </span></p>
<p><a title="ActBlue Page for Andrew Yang" href="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/new__goala"><strong>So I’m asking you today—chip in to help us raise $3.5M by the end of June.</strong></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  If everyone on this list donates $20, we will hit our goal instantly.  That is the MATH.  With your help, we make the case that we are the candidate to beat in 2020.</span></p>
