<p>New Yorkers know as well as anyone why working families are struggling.</p>
<p>Long before I ran for the Senate, I studied why middle-class families were going broke. It’s not that people are spending more money on food or shopping than they were a generation ago (on average, they’re actually spending less). But the big stuff – rent, health insurance, college – all skyrocketed.</p>
<p>And the worst? Child care. Over the past 30 years, child care costs have jumped <em>953%</em>.</p>
<p>Bill de Blasio recognized the problem, too – and when he ran for Mayor in 2013, he promised one of the most ambitious, progressive education programs in the nation: universal preschool throughout the city.</p>
<p>Bill fought hard for the program – and he won. Today, New York City enrollment in pre-K has tripled, lifting the burden of early education costs off of hardworking parents and giving kids of all economic backgrounds a jump start in their education.</p>
<p><strong>Bill de Blasio is the sort of progressive leader that New York needs. He’s fighting his heart out to level the playing field for working families – and that’s why it’s important that Bill wins reelection this November. But he’s going to need our help.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a title="https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ew-deblasio?refcode=20171018em1" href="http://my.elizabethwarren.com/page/m/-2852d4e9/-4586bb95/6af01ae7/66bf8771/793787327/VEsH/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://my.elizabethwarren.com/page/m/-2852d4e9/-4586bb95/6af01ae7/66bf8771/793787327/VEsH/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1508446394184000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFLm6dftRIjIPxeleoDcIFQh5BdFg">Please chip in now to help Bill de Blasio finish this campaign strong – and send a message across the country that we’re ready to fight for progressive values and progressive leaders. Every dollar that Bill raises from New Yorkers like you by <span class="aBn" data-term="goog_1031784580"><span class="aQJ">October 23rd</span></span> will be matched by the city’s public finance program 6-to-1 – so your support will have six times the impact.</a></strong></p>
<p>Bill is already working on a plan to take the pre-K program even further. His “3-K for All” initiative will expand universal pre-K to 3-year-olds across the five boroughs.</p>
<p>That’s a powerfully important policy for families, for teachers, for small businesses, and people all across the city. And it will set an example for cities, states, and our country to make bold policies that level the playing field for working families.</p>
<p>But Bill needs more time in City Hall to make “3-K for All” happen. I trust Bill will keep fighting as hard as he can for families in New York. So we’re going to fight for Bill – and I hope you will, too.</p>

<p>Thanks for being a part of this,</p>
<p>Elizabeth</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>NEW YORK</strong> –  The United Probation Officers Association (UPOA) announced their endorsement for Mayor Bill de Blasio’s re-election campaign, citing the Mayor for increasing opportunities for young people.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Mayor de Blasio has been a tireless champion for the people of New York.  He’s created universal pre-K so our children can get on the right track while they’re young. He’s the kind of ally we need at City Hall, and we are proud to endorse him for re-election,” said <strong>Dalvanie K. Powell, UPOA President</strong>.</p>
<p>“Our probation officers are on the front lines every day—not only protecting our city, but also helping New Yorkers on probation continue down the right path. Their compassion and dedication to the job are invaluable resources, helping ensure that New Yorkers who have paid their debt to society are on the path toward rebuilding their lives. We owe them a debt of gratitude, and I am honored to receive their endorsement here today,” said <strong>Mayor de Blasio</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Mayor has also been endorsed by DC 1707, the Civil Service Employees Association Local 1000, the Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators Local One, Hotel Trades Council, Working Families Party, the Communications Workers of America District 1, IBEW Local 3, the United Federation of Teachers, District Council 37, SEIU 32BJ, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local One, Musicians Local 802, the RWDSU, the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association, UNITE-HERE Local 100, the Professional Staff Congress and the Laundry, Distribution and Food Service Joint Board of Workers United, and dozens of elected leaders.</p>
<p>As New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio fights for our great city every day. He fought for universal pre-K for every four-year-old in the City. He expanded the paid sick leave law to cover thousands of more workers, and raised the minimum wage for all City employees and contractors. He continued to reduce stop-and-frisk and pursued reforms to bring the NYPD and the communities they serve closer together. He expanded the number of affordable apartments and took on the landlord lobby—and under his watch, rents were frozen for two straight years. Bill de Blasio fights every day to make our city better and fairer for everyone – no matter where they live or how much money they make.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Today, Assemblymember Malliotakis assailed the building blocks of a better life for working New Yorkers, attacking Obamacare, fair scheduling legislation, paid sick leave &#8212; and even wondering whether the government should be setting a minimum wage at all.  Today&#8217;s comments came straight from a right-wing, anti-worker script, and affirm what her voting record has already made dangerously clear &#8212;  how out of touch this Trump supporting Republican is when it comes to the issues that matter to working families.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<div style="text-align: center;"><b><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">MAYOR DE BLASIO AND COUNCIL MEMBER DEBI ROSE ENDORSE EACH OTHER FOR RE-ELECTION</span></b></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;"><b>NEW YORK</b> –  Today, City Council Deputy Majority Leader Debi Rose and Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed each other in their re-election campaigns for New York City Council and New York City Mayor, respectively, citing their joint efforts to combat the opioid epidemic and their work in making streets safer and cleaner for all Staten Islanders. </span></div>
<blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">“Mayor de Blasio has worked tirelessly for Staten Islanders. From launching better and more reliable trash pickup on Staten Island to starting the 24-hour ferry service, the Mayor has shown that our borough is a priority. I am honored to endorse Mayor Bill de Blasio in his re-election effort.” said <b>Deputy Majority Leader Debi Rose</b>. “Today on Staten Island under Mayor de Blasio, over 4,000 students are now in pre-K—five times more than before,15,000 affordable housing units for seniors have been built or preserved, and all four police precincts will have neighborhood policing programs by the end of the year. I believe that electing Mayor de Blasio for 4 more years will help all Staten Islanders, and New Yorkers as a whole.”</span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">&#8220;City Council Deputy Majority Leader Debi Rose has fought for Staten Island throughout her life, and she has worked tirelessly for her constituents since being elected to represent the 49th district in the Council. From securing thousands of good-paying union jobs through economic development to securing funding for programs such as True2Life, which are dramatically reducing gun violence in the community, she has stood up for her residents time and time again. She has advocated for adding officers on the street, additional graffiti removal, more sidewalk washing, and repaving for miles of worn down roads. Neighborhoods across Staten Island are safer, more prosperous, and cleaner because of Deputy Majority Leader Rose,&#8221; said </span><b style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">Mayor de Blasio</b><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">. &#8220;And whether she is fighting for businesses devastated by Super Storm Sandy, or launching neighborhood policing to strengthen the bond between NYPD and the communities they serve, we&#8217;re constantly striving to improve neighborhoods across the borough. I am thankful for Deputy Majority Leader Rose&#8217;s endorsement today, and I&#8217;m proud to endorse her in her upcoming election. I look forward to continuing our work together to support residents on Staten Island and across the city.&#8221; </span></div>
</blockquote>
<div><span style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The Mayor has also been endorsed by the Civil Service Employees Association ( CSEA) Local 1000, the Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators Local One, Hotel Trades Council, Working Families Party, the Communications Workers of America District 1, IBEW Local 3, the United Federation of Teachers, District Council 37, SEIU 32BJ, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local One, Musicians Local 802, the RWDSU, the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association, UNITE-HERE Local 100, the Professional Staff Congress and the Laundry, Distribution and Food Service Joint Board of Workers United, and dozens of elected leaders.</span></div>

</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NYC MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, QUEENS BOROUGH PRESIDENT MELINDA KATZ ENDORSE EACH OTHER FOR RE-ELECTION</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br />
</strong><strong>New York </strong>– New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Queens Borough President Melinda Katz announced today their endorsement of each other for re-election, citing their shared commitment to protecting our immigrant communities, expanding our libraries and improving education across the borough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">
“New York, and Queens especially, will always be a beacon of hope for all who come here, and at a time when our New York way of life is under attack, we need a Mayor who will stand up for all New Yorkers. Mayor de Blasio has worked to protect our immigrant communities, has fought to build affordable housing at a record pace so more people can afford to live here, and has expanded pre-K so every four-year-old can get a jump start on a good education. That’s the kind of true progressive champion we need leading this City, and it’s why I’m proud to endorse him today,” said <strong>Queens Borough President Katz</strong>.</p>
<p>“Melinda has been a staunch advocate for her community. With her help, we recently were able to secure $32 million to build a new library in Queens and have continued to work together to strengthen the borough and its future. She is the kind of ally we need in Queens, and I’m excited to support her campaign for re-election,” said <strong>Mayor de Blasio</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Mayor has also been endorsed by the Civil Service Employees Association Local 1000, IUOE, New York State Nurses Association, the Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators Local One, Hotel Trades Council, Working Families Party, the Communications Workers of America District 1, IBEW Local 3, the United Federation of Teachers, District Council 37, District Council 1707, SEIU 32BJ, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local One, Musicians Local 802, the RWDSU, the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association, UNITE-HERE Local 100, the Professional Staff Congress and the Laundry, Distribution and Food Service Joint Board of Workers United, and dozens of elected leaders.</p>
<p>As New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio has fought every day for our great city. He has passed universal Pre-K for every four-year-old in the City. He has expanded paid sick leave to cover thousands of more workers. And, he has raised the minimum wage for all City employees and contractors. He has also tirelessly worked to reduce stop and frisk and pursued reforms to bring the police and community closer together, while also driving crime to an all-time low. Mayor de Blasio has expanded the number of affordable apartments and took on the landlord lobby—and under his watch, rents were frozen for two straight years. He fights every day to make our city better for everyone &#8212; no matter where they live or how much money they make.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NYC MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO, BRONX BOROUGH PRESIDENT RUBEN DIAZ JR. ENDORSE EACH OTHER FOR RE-ELECTION</strong></p>
<p><strong>New York </strong>– New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr. announced today their endorsement of each other for re-election, citing their shared commitment to protecting immigrant communities and improving public safety and education across the borough.</p>
<blockquote><p>“In the age of President Trump, The Bronx and all of New York needs a strong fighter for our most vulnerable communities. Bill de Blasio&#8217;s commitment to enacting a progressive agenda on issues such as affordable housing, providing access to counsel for housing court tenants, protecting our at-risk immigrant communities and creating a model for universal pre-K has set the example for cities across the nation on how to move forward on important issues in the face of a hostile federal government. I look forward to helping Bill de Blasio get reelected as our mayor, and I will stand with him for the next four years shoulder-to-shoulder to battle the destructive Trump agenda and improve the quality of life for all New Yorkers,” said <strong>Bronx Borough President Diaz</strong>.</p>
<p>“Ruben is an incredible advocate for his community and a strong ally in the fight to promote progressive values. Together, we’ve made tremendous progress strengthening the Bronx and improving the lives of the people that live across this great borough. But there is still more work to be done, and we can’t stop now, which is why I’m proud to announce my support for his re-election campaign,” said <strong>Mayor de Blasio</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Mayor has also been endorsed by the Civil Service Employees Association Local 1000, IUOE, New York State Nurses Association, the Council of School Supervisors &amp; Administrators Local One, Hotel Trades Council, Working Families Party, the Communications Workers of America District 1, IBEW Local 3, the United Federation of Teachers, District Council 37, District Council 1707, SEIU 32BJ, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local One, Musicians Local 802, the RWDSU, the Uniformed Sanitationmen’s Association, UNITE-HERE Local 100, the Professional Staff Congress and the Laundry, Distribution and Food Service Joint Board of Workers United, and dozens of elected leaders.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>NEW YORK STATE’S LARGEST NURSES UNION ENDORSES </strong><strong>BILL DE BLASIO FOR MAYOR</strong></p>
<p><strong>NEW YORK, NY –</strong> The New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA), as an extension of the work fighting for quality and affordable patient care for all New Yorkers, today issued endorsements for candidates running in the upcoming 2017 Primary Election.  NYSNA – which represents nearly 40,000 registered nurses throughout the state – has led the fight to safeguard hospitals and healthcare agencies and ensuring health care access in every community in New York.</p>
<blockquote><p>“These candidates have a proven history of fighting to protect NYC Health + Hospitals against the onslaught of budget cuts coming from Washington. That’s why NYSNA is officially making these endorsements today,” <strong>said Judith Cutchin, RN, President of the NYSNA NYC Health + Hospitals/Mayoral Agencies Executive Council and a registered nurse at Woodhull Medical Center.</strong>“Every day, they stand up and fight for New York City residents, they fight to keep our public hospitals open and serving our most vulnerable patients and on behalf of the thousands of nurses in NYC and the thousands that serve within our public hospital system, we applaud and enthusiastically support these candidates who stand with our patients and communities.”</p>
<p>“As Mayor, my administration has made improving the physical and mental health of all our residents a top priority, but in order to effectively do this, we must ensure that our medical infrastructure is properly staffed with high-quality health care professionals &#8212; especially nurses. NYSNA has been on the front lines of some of the biggest health challenges facing our great city. It’s a true honor to stand by their side and receive their endorsement here today. Together, I know we can continue to build a better, healthier future for all New Yorkers,” <strong>said Mayor de Blasio</strong>.</p></blockquote>
