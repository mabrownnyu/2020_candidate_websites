This Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (the “Policy”) explains how we use information you provide while visiting our Site, and applies to your access to and use of the Site. We may modify this Policy from time to time, so we encourage you to check this page for updates.</p>
<h5>How We Use Your Information</h5>
<p>We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>
<p>When you register, contribute, make a purchase, sign up to volunteer, communicate with us via third party Internet sites, or take any other action on our Site, we may collect information about you, such as contact information, including your name, address, telephone number and/or email address, and any other information you choose to share. We also may obtain information about you from outside sources and add it to or combine it with the information we collect through this Site. We are required by federal campaign finance law to use our best efforts to collect and disclose certain information, including the name, mailing address, occupation, and employer of all individuals whose contributions exceed $200 per election cycle.</p>
<p>We use this information to operate the Site, send you news and information about the Campaign and other candidates, issues, and organizations that we support, solicit your participation in our programs, events, and activities, obtain and confirm your attendance at events, contact you if federal campaign finance laws require us to request additional information from you, and for other purposes described in this Policy or described to you at the time the information is collected. Submitting your personal information will sign you up to receive emails and/or calls.</p>
<h5>Cookies, Advertising, and Data Tracking</h5>
<p>A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.</p>
<p>Our Site uses a cookie and may use other similar tracking tools for measuring aggregate web statistics, and traffic, and other information. We also use cookies to facilitate your online visit by maintaining data that you provide for online activities for your convenience so that you will not need to resubmit certain information.</p>
<p>We may also use third-party services such as Google Analytics that collect information about you and your website use. This helps us understand traffic patterns and know if there are problems with our Site. We may also use tools in emails to track information about our mailings for various reasons. We are not responsible for and do not control how third-party services use your information.</p>
<p>We may place online advertising with third parties which will be shown on other sites on the Internet. In some cases, those third parties may decide which ads to show you based on your prior visits to the Site. At no time will you be personally identified to those third parties, nor will any of the information you share with us be shared with those third party vendors. If you prefer to opt out of the use of these third party cookies on the site, you can do so by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Advertising Initiative opt out page</a>.</p>
<p>We log standard technical information, such as your IP address and the kind of browser you use. We log this information for troubleshooting purposes and to track which pages people visit in order to improve the Site. We do not use log files to track a particular individual’s use of the website.</p>
<h5>How We Share Your Information</h5>
<p>We will not share your information except as described in this Policy.

<p>If you sign an online petition, you understand that such petition is public information and that we may make the petition, and your name, city, state, and any comments provided in connection therewith publicly available. In addition, we may provide such petitions or compilations thereof, including your comments, name, city, and state to national, state or local leaders, or to the press.</p>
<p>The Site may use social media plugins that let people share actions they take across web. Plugins may share your browsing information with the social media sites even if you do not click on the plugin or are logged out of your social media account.</p>
<h5>How We Protect Information You Provide</h5>
<p>We use industry standard security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Although we make good faith efforts to store information collected in a secure operating environment, including environments operated by third parties, we cannot guarantee complete security.</p>
<p>When you make a contribution through this website, we collect credit card information from you. That information is used solely for processing your contribution; is not maintained by us; is transmitted via third-party payment processing provider (and according to the payment processing provider’s security protocols) for processing, and is never disclosed to anyone for any other purpose other than for processing your contribution under any circumstance.</p>
