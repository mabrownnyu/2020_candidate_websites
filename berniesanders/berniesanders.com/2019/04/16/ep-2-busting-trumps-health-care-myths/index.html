<p><strong>Eileen Garcia: </strong>[00:00:00] When I left home for college, literally the same August that I left for college, we got a notice from the healthcare plan that my premium was being increased three hundred percent. And suddenly we were thrown in a whirlwind where I was trying to figure out how to apply for Medicaid again because I went out of state for school. My parents could not afford to put me on their insurance from their employer. We just could not afford it. Again, my dad makes a thousand dollars over the threshold. </p>
<p>[00:00:17] <strong>Cut to News: </strong>[00:00:17] Why can&#8217;t the free
market work?</p>
<p>[00:00:27] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:00:27] This is Hear
the Bern, a podcast about the people, ideas, and politics that are driving the
Bernie Sanders 2020 campaign and the movement to secure a dignified life for
everyone living in this country. My name is Briahna Joy Gray, coming to you
from Bernie&#8217;s campaign headquarters in Washington, DC. </p>
<p>[00:00:48] To be honest, when I sent out an office-wide
Slack message to see if anyone had any interest in sharing their health
insurance stories with me, I didn&#8217;t expect to get much of a response. The
staff, at least those who are active on Slack, tend to skew young, and young
people tend to skew healthy and insured. Especially since the Affordable Care
Act allows folks to stay on their parents&#8217; insurance until age 26. </p>
<p>[00:01:13] But the thing about private health insurance is
that, even when it&#8217;s working, it&#8217;s often not working well. Forty-three percent
of adults with health insurance are struggling to afford their deductibles.
About a third can&#8217;t afford their premiums. Medical bills are the number one
cause of bankruptcy, and nearly half of those who get cancer exhaust their
entire life savings in two years. Tens of millions of people are skipping or
delaying the treatment they need, and tens of thousands die each year because
they can&#8217;t get care. The conversations I had with my co-workers about this
reflected that reality. </p>
<p>[00:01:49] So we&#8217;re all here today to talk about how much we
love our insurers, right? No?</p>
<p>[00:01:55] <strong>Julia Griffin: </strong>[00:01:55] Not exactly. </p>
<p>[00:01:56] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:01:56] That&#8217;s Eileen
Garcia, head of Spanish translations at the Bernie 2020 campaign, and Julia
Griffin, a graphic design associate here. </p>
<p>[00:02:04] But I hear this all the time when I&#8217;m watching
TV, pundits get on and they ask people questions about what are you going to do
about the fact that Americans love their insurance companies? </p>
<p>[00:02:15] <strong>Cut to News: </strong>[00:02:15] Now, do you worry
that that is going to be politically unpalatable to Americans, many of whom
have private insurance that they like and they&#8217;re comfortable with. Is that
going to be too big a change too fast? </p>
<p>[00:02:27] <strong>Julia Griffin: </strong>[00:02:27] Like are they talking
to normal people? Like I don&#8217;t know who says that.</p>
<p>[00:02:31] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:02:31] So what have
your experiences been like if they haven&#8217;t been a love story between you and
Blue Cross Blue Shield.</p>
<p>[00:02:38] <strong>Julia Griffin: </strong>[00:02:38] So I am 23. So,
I&#8217;m still covered luckily under my father&#8217;s insurance. And he luckily has like
a really great job and great benefits and we have Blue Cross Blue Shield. I can
go to any doctor. It&#8217;s fine. Relatively low co-pays. But I got sick this past
January. January 1 you get a new deductible. My dad is thrifty, so we have a
high deductible. And since I was the one racking it up, I was on paying for it.
I got to spend Christmas in the emergency room, and I had multiple emergency
room visits, and they had to do all these weird tests on me, and I just kept
getting socked with bill after bill after bill. I had just graduated from
college, and I had like no money. </p>
<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:03:32] That&#8217;s Julia.
Not only did she find herself paying thousands of dollars out of pocket due to
her father&#8217;s thriftiness, she also felt that doctors insufficiently credited
her pain both because she&#8217;s plus-sized and because she&#8217;s a woman. </p>
<p>[00:03:46] <strong>Julia Griffin: </strong>[00:03:46] The tests they
were running, because I am a plus-sized woman, they all assumed, you know, you
just have gallbladder issues because you&#8217;re fat, and they just focused entirely
on my gallbladder. Like the first ER trip I had, the doctor was male. I was in
extreme pain. Like I woke my boyfriend up, and he had to drive me to the
emergency room in the middle of the night on Christmas. And the guy was like,
you should just be taking Advil. Like I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s wrong with you.
There&#8217;s nothing showing up on the scans. You should just go home. </p>
<p>[00:04:19] And I&#8217;m like, I come from a family where we push
through pain. Women, we are used to pushing through pain. But like when it does
get to the point where we are, okay, we&#8217;re going to the emergency room in the
middle of the night, like I&#8217;m not just someone out looking for drugs. Like I
need help.</p>
<p>[00:04:36]<strong> Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:04:36] And Eileen?
She seems to have experienced every flaw of our very flawed system, from high
deductibles, to being kicked off Medicaid, to having to ration her insulin.
Well, I&#8217;ll let her tell it.</p>
<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Eileen Garcia: </strong>[00:04:51] When I was a
year old, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, which for people who don&#8217;t know
type 1 is the autoimmune version of diabetes. So, the beta cells in my pancreas
attack themselves. And my pancreas no longer produces insulin. So, I need
insulin in order to survive. That&#8217;s a hormone that your body is supposed to
naturally produce, without which you can&#8217;t convert glucose into energy, and you
will die. </p>
<p>[00:05:16] When I was diagnosed, I was fortunate enough that
my family was eligible for Medicaid, and for a good portion of my childhood
that was how I got coverage. But when I was about 8 years old, suddenly my dad
made a thousand dollars over the Medicaid threshold. So, I was transferred to
KidCare of Florida and, while expensive, we were, you know, cutting where we
had to cut and making ends meet because I need insulin. You know, that&#8217;s a
non-negotiable drug. When I turned 18, I was then kicked off of KidCare, and so
we were in a scramble trying to find insurance because they gave me a month&#8217;s
notice that I was no longer going to have insurance. </p>
<p>[00:06:01] And thankfully that was in 2016 to 2017. So,
Obamacare was a thing. Thank God. My parents went to an Obamacare center, and
we were enrolled in an Obamacare plan, and that literally saved my life. It was
with an affordable premium, a very low deductible. So, it was exactly what we
needed. </p>
<p>[00:06:22] But when I left home for college, literally the
same August that I left for college, we got a notice from the healthcare plan
that my premium was being increased three hundred percent. And suddenly we were
thrown in a whirlwind where I was trying to figure out how to apply for
Medicaid again because I went out of state for school. My parents could not afford
to put me on their insurance from their employer. We just could not afford it.
Again, my dad makes a thousand dollars over the threshold. We can&#8217;t afford
that. </p>
<p>[00:06:58] And it took about two months for me to get the
Medicaid process figured out, during which I completely ran out of my insulin
pump supplies and had to be transferred to multiple daily injections in an
emergency because I was going to run out of insulin.</p>
<p>[00:07:17] Medicaid is great and I hate complaining about it
because it saved my life when I needed it. But it has very strict rules about
the kinds of medications you can get and how much of that medication you can
get. And so, I was using literal inch and a half long needles to give my
injections that were causing huge bruises all over my body. And I was fighting
with the doctor, fighting with the insurance to get them to cover different
needles. Kept getting denied. So eventually I started rationing my injections
and trying to spread them out because it was so painful. </p>
<p>[00:07:55] Thankfully, now through school, I had to take out
student loans, but partially to cover the health insurance provided by my
school.</p>
<p>[00:08:04] At least with this private insurance, I&#8217;m able to
get needles that are comfortable for me to use so that I&#8217;m not rationing my
injections. I had to change the type of insulin that I was using. I used to use
a fast-acting insulin called NovoLog. My insurance made me&#8230;technically their
preferred insulin is Admelog, which is very new to the market. So, I was
hesitant to use it, and so I went with their tier two insulin, which is
Humalog, and it hasn&#8217;t been too great. It&#8217;s supposed to be a seamless
transition, but it hasn&#8217;t been very seamless so far. I&#8217;ve noticed I&#8217;ve had to
use about double the amount of Humalog than I was using of NovoLog. But trying
to make it work, you know? </p>
<p>[00:08:55] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:08:55] You&#8217;re making
me want to leave this podcast recording studio and grab a banner and start
protesting in the street, but we&#8217;re like already at the Bernie Sanders
headquarters. We&#8217;re already on it!</p>
<p>[00:09:05] Already on it indeed. The day after we recorded
the interview with Eileen and Julia, Bernie Sanders announced his new Medicare
for All bill. </p>
<p>[00:09:14] <strong>Bernie Sanders: </strong>[00:09:14] Healthcare is a
human right, not a privilege. It is not a radical idea to say that in the
United States every American who goes to a doctor should be able to afford the
prescription drugs he or she needs. </p>
<p>[00:09:40] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:09:40] It&#8217;s aimed at
addressing all of the issues raised by both Julia and Eileen&#8217;s stories. It
would decouple healthcare access from employment and give everyone, everyone,
healthcare coverage, preventing the situation wherein Eileen had to ration the
insulin she needs to stay alive. It would eliminate out-of-pocket costs,
including the high deductibles experienced by Julia, who found herself paying
thousands of dollars for tests. And it would get rid of premiums, making it so
that no one ever has to experience a sudden hike, like the three hundred
percent rise Eileen experienced just as she started college. </p>
<p>[00:10:17] Bernie Sanders plan understands that there&#8217;s a
better way, as evidenced by the fact that every other major country in the
world has some form of universal healthcare. </p>
<p>[00:10:26] <strong>Bernie Sanders: </strong>[00:10:26] We are going to
end the international embarrassment of the United States of America, our great
country, being the only major nation on Earth not to guarantee healthcare to
all as a right. That is going to end. </p>
<p>[00:10:46] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:10:46] Healthcare
matters. So, I wasn&#8217;t surprised to discover that my co-workers’ experiences
with our healthcare system almost uniformly informed their choice to commit
themselves to the Bernie 2020 campaign. </p>
<p>[00:10:58] <strong>Georgia Parke: </strong>[00:10:58] For me, this is
probably one of the biggest reasons that I support Bernie, why I believe in
Bernie, why I want him to be the president, is because we just have to have
universal healthcare that is free at the point of service with no co-pays and
no deductibles. And that&#8217;s Bernie&#8217;s Medicare for All plan. And that is not the
case with any other proposals that are currently out there. It just it has to
be Medicare for All. </p>
<p>[00:11:27] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:11:27] Georgia, a
senior social media strategist, is a childhood cancer survivor. Diagnosed with
stage 4 neuroblastoma at the age of five, she was able to get excellent care
because her family had good insurance. She was able to get follow-up treatment,
like the hearing aids she needed as a result of the chemotherapy. But she saw
that others weren&#8217;t so lucky and believes that everyone deserves the care she
received, regardless of how much wealth their family has.</p>
<p>[00:11:54] <strong>Georgia Parke: </strong>[00:11:54] It&#8217;s true, the
US has some of the best doctors in the world. It has some of the best medical
innovation. We have, you know, just incredible treatment options available for
people here, but the problem is that for literally millions of people they
can&#8217;t get to that through no fault of their own, just because of the
circumstances they were born in, because of the circumstances they&#8217;re currently
in. They can&#8217;t afford that. </p>
<p>[00:12:19] So I went through a lot of treatment. I went
through multiple rounds of chemotherapy. I did a stem cell transplant. I had
surgeries. And all of that I was able to get because I had insurance. So, my
belief in Medicare for All doesn&#8217;t necessarily stem from the problems that I&#8217;ve
personally experienced with the current system, but because I&#8217;ve experienced
what we are capable of. And that&#8217;s the reason I&#8217;m here recording this podcast
right now, working for Bernie to be the president of the United States, is
because I was able to get that treatment. And I don&#8217;t believe that any person
is more or less deserving of having access to that and getting the same kind of
care that I was able to get. So that&#8217;s why I think, if we are going to reach
our full potential as a country, we have to make sure everyone has that chance,
and that&#8217;s why we need Medicare for All. </p>
<p>[00:13:09] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:13:09] This simple
moral claim, that just because you have less money doesn&#8217;t mean you should be
more likely to die or live in pain, seems so obvious, so undeniably true. Maybe
that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s a norm in every other similarly situated country in the world. </p>
<p>[00:13:26] <strong>Nathan Ober: </strong>[00:13:26] I spent a year
abroad living in Denmark and as a resident studying there, I was granted access
to the healthcare system. And so, you know, as soon as I arrived in the
country, I was given a small card. It&#8217;s about the size of like a library card.
You just carry it around in your wallet. </p>
<p>[00:13:44] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:13:44] That&#8217;s Nathan
Ober, who works on the campaign scheduling and advance team. </p>
<p>[00:13:48] Is this your card? </p>
<p>[00:13:49] <strong>Nathan Ober: </strong>[00:13:49] Yeah, so if you
flip it over, so it&#8217;s just like a credit card strip. So, there&#8217;s this little
kiosk in the office. And so, you just walk in and you swipe the card and that&#8217;s
it.</p>
<p>[00:14:00] There&#8217;s no co-pays at the time of visit. There&#8217;s
no billing department that you have to fight with on the phone or in person. No
mysterious bills show up in the mail. It&#8217;s as simple as swiping a card and
seeing a doctor for free whenever you need to. </p>
<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:14:20] So no long
wait lines, no death panels?&nbsp; </p>
<p>[00:14:23] <strong>Nathan Ober: </strong>[00:14:23] No, I mean like
yeah, the waiting in line is I think a total myth, and that was not my
experience at all. Whenever I needed care, I could get that care. As soon as I
needed it without any hassle. </p>
<p>[00:14:35] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:14:35] Long lines
and wait times are far from the only myths you commonly hear bandied about when
Medicare for All comes up. And it&#8217;s no surprise why. The principal difference
between single-payer Medicare for All and the more moderate options backed by
certain other candidates is that single payer gets rid of the private insurance
companies who are acting as a middle man. This is where the savings come in.
This is how you cut administrative waste. Millions being spent on advertising
and the billions in profit that go to companies like Aetna, whose CEO alone
made fifty-nine million dollars in 2017. Not to mention all the money these
companies spend lobbying politicians in Washington. Is it any surprise that
Bernie&#8217;s plan has detractors? </p>
<p>[00:15:18] <strong>Bernie Sanders: </strong>[00:15:18] Let me tell you
exactly what this debate is about. It&#8217;s not a healthcare debate because the
current system is dysfunctional, and no one can defend spending twice as much
per capita on a healthcare system, which doesn&#8217;t cover tens of millions of
people. What this is a struggle about is the power of the insurance companies
and the drug companies who make billions of dollars in profit. They love the
current system. </p>
<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:15:42] Private
insurance and pharmaceutical companies have been throwing millions at thwarting
universal healthcare for years. And now that it&#8217;s overwhelmingly popular among
Americans, they&#8217;re doing anything they can to make us settle for less.</p>
<p>[00:15:55] In one of the most entertaining and cathartic
news segments I&#8217;ve heard in a long time, Dr. Adam Gaffney, an instructor in
medicine at Harvard Med School, schooled six Fox News pundits, who threw every
myth in the book at him. </p>
<p>[00:16:08] <strong>Cut to News: </strong>[00:16:08] The cost would be
extraordinary, would it it not? How you going to get a million doctors to take
a pay cut? The hospitals go out of business, the doctors all just no longer
work because they&#8217;re not getting paid. I mean, then where are you going for
care? How can you guarantee that our quality of healthcare won&#8217;t go down the
way it has gone down in Great Britain as a result of their socialized system?
Why can&#8217;t the free market work? A true free market in healthcare is something
no nation, no civilized nation, would ever accept. You&#8217;d have people literally
dying on the street because they couldn&#8217;t afford the care.</p>
<p>[00:16:41] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:16:41] but we don&#8217;t
need a Harvard Med School degree to do just as good a job.</p>
<p>[00:16:45] So for this week&#8217;s praxis segment, where we put
ideas to action, let&#8217;s play healthcare red herring: how to spot them, how to beat
them, and how to convince your mother/father/sister/brother/cousin/best
friend/partner/boss that healthcare is a human right. </p>
<p>[00:17:00] Helpfully, Trump Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee
Sanders, no relation, summarized the empty arguments against Medicare for All
in a statement released the day of Bernie&#8217;s Medicare for All bill. </p>
<p>[00:17:11] The statement claims, and I quote,
self-proclaimed socialist Senator Bernie Sanders is proposing a total
government takeover of healthcare that would actually hurt seniors, eliminate
private health insurance for a hundred and eighty million Americans, and
cripple our economy and future generations with unprecedented debt. </p>
<p>[00:17:29] Okay, one sentence, four healthcare corrections.
Let&#8217;s do this.</p>
<p>[00:17:34] First, I&#8217;d like to point out that the total
government takeover is simply moving from private insurance, which people hate
because, you know, it regularly kills and bankrupts people, to public Insurance
like Medicare, which people generally love. And you don&#8217;t have to take my word
for it.</p>
<p>[00:17:50] Look at the stats. Sixty nine percent of
Americans rate their health care coverage as excellent or good. That&#8217;s
excluding, of course, the twelve percent of Americans who have no healthcare at
all. But when you break out the group over 65, the group of Americans who are
eligible for Medicare, that number jumps from 69 to 88 percent approval. </p>
<p>[00:18:12] This segueways into my second correction. The
fear-mongering about how Sanders wants to quote eliminate private health insurance
is a total deflection. You hear this one, unfortunately, from folks on both
sides of the aisle. This false equivalence between Sanders, who wants to
replace private insurance with universal single-payer coverage, i.e. something
better, and Trump, who wants to strip insurance for millions of Americans
without providing any alternative. Americans rightly fear losing their
insurance because, so far, that can mean anything from background stress to a
total disaster. But under Medicare for All that would no longer be the case. </p>
<p>[00:18:50] The thing is, the people who are truly invested
in maintaining private health insurance are the ones making money hand over
fist by charging us high premiums, ridiculous deductibles, and astronomical
copays. If anyone tries this with you, you should point out that people love
their doctors, not their insurance companies.</p>
<p>[00:19:09] Third, Bernie&#8217;s plan wouldn&#8217;t hurt seniors. It
would expand the benefits they already get under Medicare to include vision,
hearing aids, and dental services. </p>
<p>[00:19:20] And fourth, Medicare for All wouldn&#8217;t cripple our
economy. Medicare for All costs two trillion dollars less than what we
currently pay for a system that doesn&#8217;t even adequately insure us all.
Remember, under Medicare for All, all of those hefty premiums and deductibles
and co-pays would simply go away. Between that and reduced administrative
costs, the average American will have more money in their pocket at the end of
the month, not less. As Bernie says we can&#8217;t afford not to switch away from our
current system.</p>
<p>[00:19:53] Let&#8217;s run through some other common attacks. They
say Medicare for All will result in hospital closures. We say, if anything, the
opposite is true. US hospitals and rural areas are already closing at an
alarming rate, 72 of them between 2010 and 2016, according to the North
Carolina Rural Health Research Program. The result is that there are now large
stretches of this country that are virtual medical deserts. Why? Because
providing medical care in those areas wasn&#8217;t sufficiently profitable. </p>
<p>[00:20:25] They say we&#8217;ll have fewer doctors. We say
Medicare for All doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;ll need to cut doctors&#8217; salaries. Again,
the savings come from much lower administrative and drug costs. Plus, doctors
will no longer need to spend so much of their time arguing with private
insurers. Trust us, plenty of people will still want to become doctors.</p>
<p>[00:00:00] They say quality of care will suffer. We say
quality of care is already suffering. We have the worst health outcomes among
major economies. American women today are fifty percent more likely to die in
childbirth then our mothers, and life expectancies are actually declining. This
in the richest country in the world.</p>
<p>[00:00:19] This is not radical stuff. Many other countries,
including our neighbor to the north, have adopted systems very similar to what
Sanders is proposing. We&#8217;re not reinventing the wheel here. The only good
reason to oppose Medicare for All is if your name is Mark Bertolini. That&#8217;s
Aetna&#8217;s CEO. Mark, if you&#8217;re listening to this, what can I say? I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll
get by with your seventy-six million net worth. </p>
<p>[00:00:43] Perhaps the biggest red herring involves this
notion of choice. </p>
<p>[00:00:48] <strong>Cut to News: </strong>[00:00:48] The fact of the
matter is that under Medicare for All your choice of health coverage
disappears. What happens is you wind up eliminating choice. Your only choice is
the plan that the government offers. Government-run healthcare takes medical
decisions away from patients, that means you, and puts them in the hands of
bureaucrats. </p>
<p>[00:01:09] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:01:09] But the only
choice being protected is the choice of insurance companies not to extend
coverage to you. You don&#8217;t have choice when you can&#8217;t afford the treatments
your doctor prescribes. You don&#8217;t have a choice when you&#8217;re a stay-at-home
parent and you lose insurance because your partner dies. Think about it. You
have to work to get health insurance, but being sick means you can&#8217;t work. It
doesn&#8217;t make any sense. No one would choose this kind of a system. And we don&#8217;t
have to put up with it. </p>
<p>[00:01:50] We&#8217;ve been talking about Medicare for All in
fairly general terms up until this point, but the reality is that not everyone
is equally affected by the flaws in our healthcare system. Hispanics are the
most under-insured population in this country. About one out of every three
non-elderly Hispanics are uninsured. The number is one in four for black
Americans. So, I talked to Dr. Heather Gautney, a senior policy advisor for the
Bernie Sanders campaign, about how the Bernie Sanders Medicare for All bill
really does help us all. </p>
<p>[00:02:27] So Dr. Gautney, you wrote an article earlier this
year in Jacobin where you argued that health insurance and racial justice
efforts go hand-in-hand. When I read that I remember thinking about the Black
Lives Matter platform, which actually includes universal healthcare as one of
its important prongs. Can you talk a little bit more about the relationship
between racial justice and health access? </p>
<p>[00:02:49] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:02:49] Sure, the
impetus for writing that article was I had a fascinating conversation with a
reparations advocate, and she&#8217;s for Medicare for All not because it&#8217;s a silver
bullet for addressing racial disparities in healthcare, but because it&#8217;s an
absolutely necessary first step. And part of the reason is because black and
Latino populations are the absolute least likely to be insured and most likely
to be underinsured.</p>
<p>[00:03:23] I started to look at what was out there. There
wasn&#8217;t a lot in terms of legitimizing Medicare for All by looking at it through
a racial lens, but there was a study that I found on the VA, and it was in
particular about cardiovascular patients at the VA, and they had concluded that
because, you know, the Veterans Administration is like a quasi-single-payer
institution, that some black patients actually did better than their white
counterparts. So, I thought, well, you know, that&#8217;s actually an argument for
Medicare for All. There were other studies out there on the Medicare system,
and certainly there are racial disparities in Medicare that Medicare for All
would not address. They exist in that system, and likely Medicare for All would
have to be more targeted toward point of contact discrimination, but the
disparities reduced after people entered into the Medicare system. </p>
<p>[00:04:21] And then there&#8217;s an intersection between race,
class, and gender, the coverage of reproductive health and maternity health.
Black women are 243 times more likely to die from pregnancy related or
childbirth related complications, and that is&#8230; </p>
<p>[00:04:47] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:04:47] That&#8217;s out of
control.</p>
<p>[00:04:48] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:04:48] Yeah,
staggering, and the highest in women&#8217;s health. And I did not know this until
today&#8230;Erica Garner was one of our beloved surrogates in 2016. It was
suspected that this was the cause of her death. These kind of disparities,
Medicare for All would improve access to those services, and that&#8217;s part of the
reason why this is the high mortality rate because of lack of access to
services.</p>
<p>[00:05:17] There&#8217;s also the dimension, and this is in the
bill, of home and community-based care, which is largely women&#8217;s work. And that
has to do of course with job discrimination and also gender relationships
between men and women.</p>
<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:05:34] Cultural
norms, yadda yadda, yeah.</p>
<p>[00:05:35] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:05:35] Exactly. Yeah,
and I have personal experience with this because my mother, who recently passed
away, her husband had Parkinson&#8217;s disease. And my mother was 75. He was 80, and
he wasn&#8217;t eligible for more than an hour like every other day of home care. So,
she was in a position of having to care for him. Parkinson&#8217;s disease is a
serious disease. Elderly people fall. They break bones. They can&#8217;t shower. His
hands had tremors. So, there was a lot of really basic things that he couldn&#8217;t
do that she had to help him with. And she was essentially alone. She lived in a
rural community in Maine. There was not a lot of people around to kind of pick
up the slack. </p>
<p>[00:06:23] As soon as she kind of stepped away from his care
&#8211; his family kind of stepped in and our family stepped in &#8211; she became very
ill, and it was just clear to us that she had not been able to take care of
herself because of the stress and the exertion associated with caring for him. </p>
<p>[00:06:40] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:06:40] I think
that&#8217;s a really powerful point, the extent to which because women play an
outsized role in home care, and in the same way that Medicare for All
disproportionately benefits blacks and Latinos, women another historically
marginalized group that are going to end up being disproportionately benefited
by the provisions of the Medicare for All bill, which offer more support for
home care. </p>
<p>[00:07:05] Your story resonates with me also because
something very similar was happening recently with my own grandparents. My
grandfather had a stroke about a decade ago and had been bedridden ever since.
My grandmother was a registered nurse who hasn&#8217;t worked in years because she
suffered an injury moving a patient, a back injury moving a patient from a
gurney to a bed. Now she&#8217;s in a position where she was having to help my
grandfather move around. She already can&#8217;t help people around, obviously,
that&#8217;s how she incurred her injury in the first place. But she&#8217;s in these tense
situations with him where there&#8217;s an emergency. He has to get up and go to the
bathroom. There&#8217;s not home health aides available, and it&#8217;s exacerbated her own
condition. And after he passed, now her own health is declining as well. And
it&#8217;s this vicious cycle. </p>
<p>[00:07:48] So I also wanted to ask you a little bit about an
article that you mentioned when we were chit-chatting yesterday that was
written by Vann Newkirk in the Atlantic last year that highlighted the ways in which
the fight for healthcare in this country has been linked to the fight for civil
rights. </p>
<p>[00:08:07] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:08:07] There was a
bill that was about discrimination and hospitals. It was like a labor-oriented
bill. </p>
<p>[00:08:15] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:08:15] Yeah. The
NAACP sued a segregated hospital over segregation, and what the court finally
ended up holding is that any institution that receives federal funds couldn&#8217;t
abide by separate but equal. And what that ended up doing, once we got Medicare
and Medicaid in the mid-1960s &#8211; the first case was a 1963 case &#8211; and by 1965
when we got Medicare and Medicaid, and all of the hospitals in the country
basically started receiving public funding, that basically meant all of the
hospitals in the country had to desegregate.</p>
<p>[00:08:49] There is this interesting way where there&#8217;s this
coupling of this fight for equality and a fight for healthcare that stretches
back to the Civil Rights era and probably before that. One of the first points
you made was that, sure, every inequity in healthcare is not going to be
resolved by Medicare for All, but in the same way that it&#8217;s a fallacy to say,
will breaking up the banks cure racism? No. I mean, we should still break up
the banks, right? There are of course racial disparities in how the financial
crisis hurt people, right. Black people lost forty percent of their net wealth,
of our net wealth in the crisis. In the same way, there&#8217;s this way in which
just because the Medicare for All bill doesn&#8217;t do it all, we need to keep
talking about how to supplement it and how to deal with point of access
discrimination etcetera. It is such a crucial foundational backbone aspect to
getting substantive equality across racial and other historically marginalized
groups that those who would seek to marginalize it by pointing to the fact that
it doesn&#8217;t do it all are really doing a disservice to the groups that they&#8217;re
trying to help. </p>
<p>[00:09:57] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:09:57] One of the
things that I think people forget in the Civil Rights Movement. There were
figures like A. Philip Randolph, who had the freedom budget. And if you look at
the freedom budget, it is pretty identical to what Senator Sanders is
proposing. I think Randolph used to use the language of the common man, which is
very similar to the Senator&#8217;s project.</p>
<p>[00:10:22] But this was in the context of the fight, the
struggle for civil rights, and of course that&#8217;s around the same time that King
arrives at having to confront poverty and getting interested in labor issues.
And this is I think where economic and racial justice sort of blend. And then
they kind of separated away, apart from each other. So, I see this moment as a
time when that relationship is being once again recognized and addressed. </p>
<p>[00:10:53] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:10:53] It might
surprise people to hear this quote, but it shouldn&#8217;t from Dr. Martin Luther
King. He said of all the inequalities that exist, the injustice in healthcare
is the most shocking and inhuman.</p>
<p>[00:11:05] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:11:05] Yeah. Yep,
that&#8217;s a great, famous, important quote to remember. The other thing I wanted
to say with regard to what you were talking about in terms of what Medicare for
All doesn&#8217;t do. I was speaking with one of the Senator Sanders&#8217; health staffers,
and she made that same point. I mean she’s got her hands right in there, and I
mean helped build this bill out. Really got into the weeds on it. And she said
but we&#8217;re still going to have to figure out ways of doing targeted repairing of
what&#8217;s happened in certain communities. And if we can&#8217;t get this baseline of
Medicare for All, then we&#8217;re not going to be able to solve the bigger problems
within the healthcare system.</p>
<p>[00:11:50] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:11:50] This is like
an ongoing preoccupation for me. Anybody who follows me on Twitter and knows
how online I am has heard me make this argument. But it&#8217;s like the piece of
that question that&#8217;s like, well will this cure racism, that project is an
undeniably important project, but it&#8217;s also perhaps the most difficult to pin
down. How do you on a policy level cure racism? So, it&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m not
interested in that piece. Will breaking up the banks cure racism, will Medicare
for All cure racism? The answer is no. And it&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t deeply care
about the fact that racism is a persistent and ongoing ill. It&#8217;s that, in light
of an absence of workable ways from a political perspective to change the
hearts and minds of people, to ignore the constructive, substantive, structural
ways that you can start to change outcomes seems to be perverse. </p>
<p>[00:12:47] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:12:47] Yeah, the way
I kind of think about it is like the institutions that foster integration have
been completely defunded. Public education is a place &#8211; I mean, and not New
York City now, because public schools are the most segregated schools in the
country, and we are pre-Brown versus Board of Education.</p>
<p>[00:13:07] But if this system is working and properly
funded, these are places where people learn from each other, right, and get
used to seeing each other and living with each other and also learning history
and different versions of history. And when you defund those institutions and
you allow people to live separately, then you&#8217;re kind of not dealing with the
core of the cultural level. Unions are another thing. Unions are places where
often, you know, unions can be diverse institutions, and to state the obvious,
in steep decline. They barely exist anymore.</p>
<p>[00:13:44] That&#8217;s the other thing I really like about what
Senator Sanders&#8217; program does is it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the public sphere
and trying to reinvest in the institutions that can actually solve some of
these problems. Or not solve, but at least mitigate them. And then you don&#8217;t
have &#8211; the likelihood of fake news and all the racist stuff that Trump says
falls on deaf ears because people know better. But you have a weak education
system. And don&#8217;t get me wrong. I don&#8217;t think education is the silver bullet
either on this, but certainly if you degrade it, you&#8217;re really stuck. </p>
<p>[00:14:20] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:14:20] I really
appreciate you coming to talk to me and working so hard on all of these amazing
policies that are making structural changes that are getting us a little bit
closer day by day, a lot closer quite frankly, to genuine equality. Thank you.</p>
<p>[00:14:32] <strong>Heather Gautney: </strong>[00:14:32] Yeah,
absolutely.</p>
<p>[00:14:39] <strong>Briahna Joy Gray: </strong>[00:14:39] That&#8217;s it for
