<p>This Privacy Policy explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Bennet for America (the “Campaign”). This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile sites, mobile applications and other online services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”) or when you otherwise interact with us. The Sites may contain links to third-party websites for the purpose of facilitating contributions or purchases. The use of third-party websites is governed by the privacy policies of those websites.</p>
<p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email or mobile notification). We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Sites to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p>

<h2>SOCIAL SHARING FEATURES</h2>
<p>The Sites may offer social sharing features and other integrated tools (such as the Facebook “Like” button), which let you share actions you take on our Sites with other media, and vice versa. The use of such features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the entity that provides the social sharing feature. For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the entities that provide these features.</p>
<h4>ADVERTISING AND ANALYTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHERS</h4>
<p>We may allow third parties to use cookies or other technologies to provide analytics services and to serve ads on other websites based on your visits to this site and other sites across the Internet. These entities may collect information about your use of the Sites and other websites, including your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by the Campaign and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and better understand your online activity.</p>
<p>For example, we may use Remarketing with Google Analytics or other remarketing tools to advertise online. This enables third-party vendors, including Google, to show our ads on sites across the Internet. Such third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website. For information on how you can opt out of Google’s use of cookies for interest-based ads please visit Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ad" target="none" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ads Settings</a>.</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>
<p>The Campaign takes reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p>
