<h4><strong>Despite recent advances, HIV is still a persistent epidemic deserving of resources dedicated towards research, education and treatment.</strong></h4>



<p>In recent decades, we have made tremendous progress in addressing the HIV epidemic, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. Hickenlooper’s plan to address this epidemic would focus on education, prevention, treatment and research to eradicate this disease. As a starting point, as president he would propose an increase in funding for the federal HIV budget to expand public understanding and awareness of prevention, testing and treatment.</p>



<p>We also need to increase access to preventative medications like PrEP through local health departments and clinics. In addition, his administration would develop HIV-stigma reduction interventions for medical professionals so that everyone is treated fairly and with respect.</p>



<p>Hickenlooper would also increase access to life-saving treatment. During his time as governor, Colorado expanded Medicaid and created one of the most innovative health exchanges in the country. It led to nearly 95% coverage. Everyone should have access to healthcare, which is why as president he would protect and build upon the Affordable Care Act. He would also support increasing federal funding for the Ryan White Program so that more people can gain access to affordable treatment.</p>



<p>It is also vital that the federal government continues to fund domestic and international research. As president, Hickenlooper would support raising federal funding for research to ensure we are taking every step to prevent the spread of HIV through high-impact prevention methods and programs.</p>

<h4><strong>It has become all too difficult to access the necessary funds to deal with an increasing number of annual natural disasters. Americans deserve a President who will act in the face of natural disasters.</strong></h4>



<p>The politicization of the disaster relief process has made it more difficult for impacted communities to obtain timely federal relief. Congress has been regularly using disaster relief packages as political cudgels and it needs to end now. Hickenlooper knows first-hand how difficult it can be to get the necessary funding. As Colorado’s Governor, he had to go to DC to repeatedly fight for disaster aid.</p>



<p>The number of billion-dollar natural disasters affecting this country is growing—between 2014 and 2018 it averaged 13 a year. From 2010–2014, in his first term as Governor, Colorado had the two worst wildfires in the history of the state and the worst flood in the history of the state – it spanned 24 counties and left entire small towns under water. Hickenlooper helped to create a roadmap for resiliency in Colorado. It is not enough to say you are going to rebuild. You have to rebuild it better than it was before, meaning more resilient to future natural disasters.</p>



<p>As climate change intensifies the number and impact of storms and other disasters, we need to invest in disaster relief as well as preparedness. This includes reforming how disaster relief is funded so that communities are less reliant on Congress for extra funding in the case of a major disaster. We also need to review how we can cut red tape and streamline disaster recovery coordination efforts among local, state and federal agencies so that our communities get back on their feet faster.</p>



<p>We must ensure that our communities are prepared for future disasters. Hickenlooper’s infrastructure plan will include targeted spending on climate change-related projects, including adaptation and mitigation measures for our communities. Preparedness also means that businesses and homeowners have insurance to cover their losses in the event of a natural disaster. This means reforming the National Flood Insurance Program and making sure that homeowners have access to affordable home insurance that covers wildfires.</p>

<h4><strong>Full security requires that we have strong alliances and partnerships abroad and that we lead on the world stage.</strong></h4>



<p>Contrary to what Mr. Trump implies, our alliances are not charity toward other countries. They are something we do for our own security. By reviving our leadership, we are not only making our country safer, but we’re making our country more prosperous.</p>



<p>Nothing demonstrates that more than NATO, history’s most successful military alliance. It is shameful that Mr. Trump threatened our commitment to NATO, and repeatedly left our allies in the lurch, such as with his declaration of unilateral withdrawal from Syria. His abandonment of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty also leaves Europe at risk, with no successor plan to control these nuclear weapons. As president, Hickenlooper will make clear the US stands resolutely by our decades-old commitment to treat an attack against any of our NATO allies as an attack against all of us.</p>



<p>As president, Hickenlooper will revive arms control discussions with both Russia and China, to increase our security and that of our allies, and to limit the looming costs of modernization of our nuclear forces.</p>



<p>As a start, Hickenlooper has called on Mr. Trump to extend the New START agreement with Russia, which limits strategic nuclear weapons, so it does not lapse in February 2021. He will seek new arrangements with Russia and with China, to address short- and medium-range weapons, all of which fall outside the parameters of New START.</p>



<p>Hickenlooper will work with our allies in East Asia to defuse tensions China has provoked over islands and navigation, and to ensure we have a full, coordinated strategy to stop North Korea’s ballistic nuclear program – not based on flattery, but on strong deterrence, verifiable agreements, and robust inspections.</p>



<p>He will also work closely with the states of the Western Hemisphere, on challenges from stemming the drug trade, to ensuring a democratic Venezuela.</p>

<h4><strong>Guaranteeing the security of this country should be a primary function of our government. There is a new war being waged by our adversaries and we must be prepared to meet these new and evolving threats.</strong></h4>



<p>As president, Hickenlooper will invest in efforts to protect against cyber-attacks. Trump obsesses about border walls; our cyber firewalls are far more important. Our country needs to wake up to the fact that a low-grade, cyber-war is already raging today, often against the US, including commercial attacks as well as direct assaults on our government, military, and the critical infrastructure systems that protect our daily lives.</p>



<p>It is a new and difficult kind of war. It is hard, and sometimes impossible, to determine who is behind a specific attack. Even when we can, we have no procedures or protocols for an appropriate response. Any use of offensive cyber capabilities runs the risk of retaliation and escalation.</p>



<p>The 2016 election showed how Russia attacked our electoral system. We remain shockingly underprepared to confront these new dangers.</p>



<p>This problem has concerned Hickenlooper for years. As Governor, he allocated state funds to help open the National Cybersecurity Center in Colorado Springs. As president, he will shift cybersecurity efforts into higher gear. Hickenlooper will create a new position, Director of National Cybersecurity, to coordinate all our national cybersecurity priorities. The new Cybersecurity Director will bring our security and intelligence agencies together to lay out a 20-year plan, to coordinate how we will harness new and emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>We will also sharpen our offensive cyber capabilities and develop policies on levels of response and when we should use them. Through constant engagement, we will lead an international effort to create a legal framework and diplomatic protocols that can prevent cyber threats from escalating into war.</p>

<p>Hickenlooper has made members of government accountable for their actions. As Governor, he asked a serial sexual harasser to step down from the legislature and supported legislative action to forcibly expunge him from the Colorado House of Representatives.</p>



<p>As a country, we need to work to counter the social norms and discrimination that allows harassment to flourish. This involves educating our youth on how to respect one another. It also means giving victims the right to pursue legal actions against their employers by amending the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>

<h4><strong>Members of the LGBTQ+ community deserve clear and unbreakable protections that are here to stay.</strong></h4>



<p>All of the incredible progress on equal rights for the LGBTQ+ community that we have made in the last decade is under assault from the Trump Administration. The recent actions to undermine the security, support, and even safety for the LGBTQ+ community are disgraceful. In Colorado, we passed civil unions, battled discrimination at every turn, and ensured that everyone had the same rights and protections under the law. Hickenlooper has been a lifelong supporter of LGBTQ+ rights and in Colorado he led real progress to make sure everyone felt welcome regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Hickenlooper supports passing the Equality Act and the Do No Harm Act today.</p>

<h4><strong>Our country needs comprehensive immigration reform that protects our boarders while valuing human life and dignity.</strong></h4>



<p>Trump’s immigration policies are immoral and un-American, separating thousands of children from their parents. Moreover, they are ineffective, as arrivals are increasing and asylum backlogs are growing. As Governor, Hickenlooper fought Trump’s immigration policies, signed historic legislation granting tuition assistance to undocumented students, and initiated a new program to grant driver licenses to undocumented immigrants</p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper will lead efforts to protect the Dreamers and enact comprehensive immigration reform. These reforms will create a pathway to legalization for unauthorized immigrants while also ensuring border security. Hickenlooper will also reverse the Trump Administration’s efforts to prevent refugees from receiving asylum in the US His plan will also call for hiring more immigration judges and support staff, to reduce a backlog that can leave immigrants waiting for years, and protect them from judicial interference, so they can do their jobs without being subject to political whims. Finally, Hickenlooper will launch a regional strategy to improve the conditions in the Northern Triangle Countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador), addressing this crisis at its source.</p>

<h4><strong>Too many women in this country are subject to harassment and violence.  We need to stand up for, protect and believe women. </strong></h4>



<p>As Governor, Hickenlooper took tangible steps to support survivors of sexual assault. He signed legislation to extend the statute of limitations on sexual assault to 20 years and to make sure rape kits are tested in a timely manner. Hickenlooper also signed a law so that rapists may not have access to survivors or her child and made revenge porn illegal in Colorado. As a country, we need to work to counter the social norms and discrimination that allows gender-based violence to plague our communities. This involves educating our youth on how to respect one another. It also means continuing to fund programs that work to prevent violence and support survivors under the Violence Against Women Act. He will also roll back the Trump Administration’s proposed changes to regulations around campus sexual assault, which make it more harrowing for victims to pursue justice.</p>

<p>When John Hickenlooper ran for Mayor, he promised to visit every public school in Denver. During his weekly public school visits, he saw the challenges but also successes. Hickenlooper knows we are not teaching our kids everything that they need to learn.</p>



<p>As a country, we need to ensure we’re teaching our kids the right things. We need to move away from limited curriculums that are focused on memorization and rote regurgitation. As President, Hickenlooper will expand work-based learning and apprenticeships: because without significant engagement between the education system and business, today’s students won’t be ready for tomorrow.</p>
