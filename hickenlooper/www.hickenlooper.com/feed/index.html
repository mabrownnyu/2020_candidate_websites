<h3><strong>Governor Hickenlooper’s Bold, Global Plan to Combat Climate Change</strong></h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>We’ll bring the same relentless innovation we used to land on the moon to save our planet…. The first thing we’re going to do is rejoin the Paris climate accord and exceed its goals. We’ll build a green economy that creates jobs that can’t be shipped overseas, while combating generations of climate change. And we will focus on the most efficient ways to address the crisis.</em></p><cite><em>John Hickenlooper, Declaration of presidential candidacy, March 2019</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>John Hickenlooper believes climate change is the defining challenge of our time. The planet’s health, our economic well-being, our communities, and our national security are all at risk. It is imperative that we urgently address the climate challenges we face—human lives and livelihoods are at stake. Climate change also presents opportunities. We can re-establish strong and dedicated global leadership on climate change by re-engaging with global partners on the Paris Agreement and lead on agreements that go beyond Paris. We can address the market failures that contribute to the crisis. We can create new jobs in emerging climate-related industries by collaborating with and incentivizing the private sector. And we can become a world leader in the development of climate change technologies. As President, Hickenlooper will lead a scientifically-grounded, focused, inclusive and affordable strategy to address climate change. &nbsp;<br></p>



<p>As Denver’s Mayor and Colorado’s Governor, Hickenlooper brought people together to launch clean energy projects and enact pioneering climate change legislation. As a small business owner, he knows that being asked to decide between good jobs and a clean environment is a false choice. As a trained geologist and the only scientist now seeking the presidency, he brings a practical, fact-based understanding of earth science. As president, Hickenlooper will lead an urgent, global effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and move humanity toward a low-carbon future.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper is running for president to end Donald Trump’s crisis of division. As part of that crisis, Trump is dividing America over the challenge of climate change, rather than uniting the country to address it, and turn the challenge into an opportunity. Trump’s retrogressive policies include withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement and rolling back restrictions on coal-fired power plants. Even as epic storms, floods, and wildfires ravage the nation, Trump denigrates climate science and has proposed an advisory board led by a climate change denier. [1] We have a duty and obligation to reject these troubling and misguided policies and act quickly and decisively to manage and mitigate the effects of climate change.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper has been one of the nation’s top leaders on climate change. He brought the environmental community and the oil and gas industry together to hammer out the country’s first regulations to control methane emissions, which has 25 times the global warming impact of carbon dioxide. [2] That regulatory effort – which Hickenlooper got the oil and gas industry to finance – has since become the model for Canada’s efforts to control methane emissions. As mayor and governor, he led the charge on ambitious clean transportation projects, including a new light-rail system in Denver [3] and a major expansion of electric vehicle recharging stations to enable long-distance electric vehicle travel [4].<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper would fight climate change the right way. Some other proposals include ideas that distract from addressing climate change directly, including a federal job guarantee for every American. These plans, while well-intentioned, could mean huge costs for American taxpayers, and might trigger a backlash that dooms the fight against climate change. As President, Hickenlooper will reverse Trump’s destructive course and launch a focused, effective, inclusive and sustainable plan that wins public support.<br></p>



<p><strong>Global leadership toward even bolder climate change goals. </strong>As Governor, Hickenlooper was active in international climate change efforts. He knows this is a <em>global </em>challenge – the US accounts for 15% of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions [5] – and therefore the only way to combat climate change is with international cooperation and ambitious American leadership. His plan is unique in that it calls for going <em>further </em>than the Paris Climate Agreement goals and proposes creating new linkages between global climate change goals and a range of America’s foreign and trade policies.</p>



<ul><li>On Hickenlooper’s first day as President, he will begin the process of rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement. </li><li>Although achieving the Paris targets will help a great deal, it is not enough. Even if all countries meet their targets, it will not hold the rise in global temperature to the “well below 2 degrees Celsius” goal set in the Paris Agreement. [6] Accordingly, Hickenlooper will build momentum, trust and collaboration with our global partners. He will do this in part by committing to mobilizing, together with other developed nations, $100 billion each year in climate financing for developing countries, a key commitment under the Paris Agreement. This renewed pledge will be in plain contrast to the misguided policies of the Trump Administration, which reneged on American commitments to the world’s leading climate finance mobilization arm, the Green Climate Fund, and other key initiatives. [7] In addition, President Hickenlooper will ensure the US ratifies the Kigali Amendment before leading an initiative to accelerate the implementation of this critical agreement, which requires countries to freeze and then phase out dangerous hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). [8] &nbsp;</li><li>As part of a new policy of “open and fair trade,” Hickenlooper will require that greenhouse gas emissions goals to combat global warming are set and enforced as part of any new US trade agreement. [9] &nbsp;</li><li>In order to bring the full weight of America’s global leadership to bear on this challenge, Hickenlooper will also condition certain US foreign aid and foreign military assistance on cooperation on climate change efforts by recipient countries. &nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>A market-based and job-creating clean energy plan for America. </strong>Hickenlooper will also launch an ambitious effort to move the US to a clean energy future, with particular reliance on market- based and inclusive job-creating initiatives. These include:</p>



<ul><li>Hickenlooper’s infrastructure plan will include targeted spending on clean energy and climate change-related projects, including adaptation and mitigation. This includes $200 billion for investments to revolutionize America’s transportation system, invest in renewable energy sources, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, plus $150 billion to make America’s electric grid more reliable, secure, efficient and resilient.</li><li>Hickenlooper’s “National Strategy for a Working America” will focus on creating millions of green jobs, as the country moves to a low-carbon future. This builds on his record as Governor: During his tenure, the number of clean energy jobs more than doubled to around 62,000. [10] [11] As in Colorado, Hickenlooper will work cooperatively with the private sector, which has a crucial role to play in achieving climate change goals. Hickenlooper strongly supports the view, put forward at the 2018 UN Climate Change Conference, that the private sector “should no longer be viewed solely as greenhouse gas emissions culprits, but more as indispensable partners for climate action.” [12] As President, Hickenlooper will ensure focused, cross-industry engagement by incentivizing public- private partnerships that address current market failures and break down barriers to innovation. For example, Hickenlooper will restore the funding that the Trump Administration withdrew from successful public-private partnerships. US and international support for critical public-private partnerships will drive additional private investment in climate change solutions. He will also engage the outdoor recreation industry, which has a tremendous stake in the health of the environment both within the US and globally.</li><li>We must unleash market forces to help solve the emissions challenge. Hickenlooper will implement a carbon tax, which experts agree [13] will create the necessary market incentives to quickly and cost-effectively lower carbon emissions, while also promoting US economic growth. He will also immediately reinstate the Obama Administration’s Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), which assigns a dollar value to each ton of harmful emissions. Simultaneously, Hickenlooper will launch a review, based on the latest scientific and economic understanding, to update the SCC. The revenue generated from the new tax will be returned directly to American taxpayers, more than offsetting any increase in energy costs. To ensure that US firms remain competitive internationally, Hickenlooper will create a carbon border adjustment system. This system will ensure that energy- efficient US firms are more competitive than their global counterparts, and it will also strongly encourage other countries to develop their own carbon pricing systems.</li><li>As part of his plan for controlling greenhouse gas emissions, Hickenlooper will use the methane regulations he enacted as Governor as the model for a nation-wide program to limit these potent greenhouse gases. He will also support crucial research into new solutions to address the challenge.</li><li>A critical pathway to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is improving the energy efficiency of buildings. As President, Hickenlooper will invest in improving the energy efficiency of buildings across the country by focusing on revising building standards and providing support to local governments and the private sector to meet the new standards. His plan will unlock the potential generated through public-private partnerships and direct engagement with communities. Hickenlooper will also nationally mandate that new construction includes charging stations for electric vehicles.</li></ul>



<p><strong>A science-based, fact-based national call to action. </strong>Hickenlooper is a pragmatist and optimist, who believes the US can achieve aspirational goals when the country is mobilized around a well- defined mission. Just as an earlier generation of leaders galvanized the country around the goal of taking Americans to the moon, Hickenlooper will rally the country to the goal of saving the planet.</p>



<ul><li>Hickenlooper will ensure that the country’s climate change efforts are always based on the best-available data and the foundation of scientific consensus. He will expand federal budgets for relevant data-gathering on climate change. He will can develop the necessary workforce skills, including technical know-how on battery storage and renewable energy, that will enable us to address the climate change challenges. Developing these skill sets will also give Americans what they need to find jobs in a growing and dynamic climate economy.</li><li>Hickenlooper will launch a new Climate Corps Program, challenging a generation of young people to pursue careers that help combat global climate change. Similar to the US space program in the 1960s, this moonshot will help develop innovative solutions and breakthrough technologies we need to address this global challenge. Hickenlooper will create a new set of scholarship and loan forgiveness programs to encourage a new generation of nuclear engineers, renewable energy experts, carbon capture specialists, energy storage scientists, and entrepreneurs who can help to address climate change and make America a global leader in climate technology. His plan will support the economic transformation needed to combat climate change, creating an opportunity for growth and jobs in emerging sectors.</li><li>Hickenlooper will also begin large-scale investment in government-funded climate technology research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) to accelerate innovation. One of the pathways to address carbon emissions is to invest in carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology, the development of renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, and in energy storage technologies. His plan will include permanently funding the Advanced Research Projects Agency – Energy (ARPA-E), which has invested $1.5 billion into over 500 projects to increase American innovation in climate technology. ARPA-E, despite criticism from the Trump Administration, has been an incredibly successful program to fund and develop and disperse innovative technologies developed in the US. [14] In fact, independent studies have shown that the budget of ARPA-E should be increased to almost three times its current size to “adequately explore” the many potentially viable projects that have applied for grant funding [15]</li><li>As a trained scientist, Hickenlooper understands that time is working against humanity on this challenge, and that we may only have one chance to get it right. He believes it would be an historic mistake to make load America’s climate change agenda with provisions that would polarize the issue and limit support. For example, he has criticized the Senate version of the Green New Deal that includes a federal job guarantee for every American, because it would lead to needless tax increases, expansion of the federal government, and reduced chances of enactment.</li></ul>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>America’s current healthcare system has become a major obstacle for economic growth and a better life for working people. The US spends far more per person on health than any other nation on earth — yet our health outcomes are no better, and our families continued to be terrorized by “surprise costs,” such as extra bills for out-of-network providers. It is a system that is failing our families and bankrupting our national resources.<br></p>



<p>The Trump administration is trying to make this already-bad picture even worse, by seeking to repeal all the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. If successful, that would mean Americans with pre-existing conditions would lose their ability to get healthcare coverage. Americans would lose their life-time caps on out-of-pocket health expenses. Young people would no longer be able to get health coverage from their parents’ health plans, up to age 26.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper believes we need to reform our healthcare system — as a matter of social justice, and as an imperative for economic growth.<br></p>



<p>That’s what Hickenlooper did as Governor. Working on a bipartisan basis, he successfully expanded Medicaid, created one of the most innovative health exchanges in the country, and brought his state to near-universal coverage. Today nearly 95% of Coloradans have healthcare coverage.<br></p>



<p>As president, he will reform the country’s health system to achieve four key goals:</p>



<ol><li>Universal coverage, because healthcare is right.</li><li>Stronger rules to control costs.</li><li>Portability, so that people can change jobs, or start a company, without fear of losing their coverage.</li><li>Ensuring that every American has a reliable place to go for their health — where the medical staff knows them and their conditions — a “medical home” — so that there is full attention to preventive and mental healthcare.</li></ol>



<p>Hickenlooper rejects the idea of “Medicare for All” — moving all Americans to a government- run single-payer healthcare system. He notes that over 150 million Americans currently get their health through private, employer-provided coverage, and that most of them are satisfied with that arrangement. Under Hickenlooper’s plan, those who wish to keep their private coverage can do so; but those who lack coverage, or wish to switch, will be able to access a public option for insurance — such as buying into a plan like Medicare — on an open and affordable basis.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper’s plan will stop the endless spiraling of national healthcare costs. It will ensure every American has access to health coverage. And it will help unlock the energy of enterprising workers and would-be small business owners, who will be able to pursue their dreams without having to worry about being bankrupted by medical bills.</p>

]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The opioid crisis is a public health epidemic, hurting both our urban and rural communities. The increase in fentanyl use is particularly alarming, which has caused a large spike in overdose deaths, particularly for our communities of color. [1]<sup> </sup>As with every public health epidemic, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, but we must address the lack of best practices for pain management and hold the large pharmaceutical companies responsible for their role in this national crisis. The odds of dying of an accidental overdose now exceed odds of a fatal traffic accident and the CDC has reported drops in life expectancy due to drug overdoses and suicides. <sup>[2]</sup><br></p>



<p>John Hickenlooper was one of the first governors in the country to try to address the rise in prescription opioid abuse and overdoses. [3] He expanded the state’s prescription drug monitoring program and limited the number of opioid pills a doctor can prescribe to a new patient. [4] He also created a grant pilot program to train medical professionals in rural areas hit hardest by the crisis, [5] permanently established Colorado’s medication take-back program, [6] and joined in a national compact with other states to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing. [6] These efforts led to a 21% drop in opioid prescriptions since 2013 and reduced opioid use in emergency departments by 36%. [8] Colorado experienced a decline in opioid-related overdose deaths from 2014 to 2015, but following national trends, opioid deaths rose in 2016, further cementing the need for continued efforts. [9]<br></p>



<p>As President, John Hickenlooper’s national strategy to address this crisis will involve partnering with states and communities across the country. His plan will also work to change the culture around prescription opioids.<br></p>



<p>Key components of his plan include:</p>



<ul><li>Creation of a grant program for training of first responders to deal with overdoses and to provide them with the lifesaving drug Naloxone:</li></ul>



<ul><li>National prescription drug buyback and disposal program</li><li>Ban advertising addictive opioid painkillers</li><li>Expanding national awareness campaigns about the risk of addiction</li><li>Expanded training and promotion of best practices related to pain management for providers</li><li>Requiring Medicaid and insurers to cover rehabilitation services</li></ul>

<p>After the tragic mass shooting at the Aurora movie theater, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper signed into law landmark reforms on gun safety that required background checks for private and online gun sales and that banned high-capacity magazines. Colorado is the first purple state to enact such meaningful gun safety legislation.<br></p>



<p>In April 2013, President Obama said, “I think that Colorado has shown that practical progress is possible thanks to the leadership of Governor Hickenlooper and some of the state legislators who are here today…I want to thank Governor Hickenlooper for his outstanding leadership.”<br></p>



<p>During his re-election campaign in 2014, a challenging year for Democrats, Governor Hickenlooper faced strong criticism from Republicans and gun rights advocates. Throughout the campaign, Governor Hickenlooper reaffirmed his support for gun safety legislation and said he would sign the limit on high-capacity magazines again.<br></p>



<p>After the Parkland shooting in February 2018, Governor Hickenlooper called for additional gun safety laws, including a ban on “bump stocks” and a “red flag” bill that would be proposed during the 2018 Colorado legislative session. During national television interviews, he urged the nation to use the Colorado model in taking on the NRA in enacting common sense proposals such as universal background checks.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>The number of deaths per year from firearms in our nation has surged to 39,773, the highest figure in the 50 years that this data has been collected. [1] Governor Hickenlooper recognizes that gun violence in our nation is a public health epidemic that requires an urgent and comprehensive set of national strategies. As President, he would institute the following policies.</em></strong></p>



<h2><strong>Education and Safety</strong></h2>



<h3><strong>National standard for gun licensing</strong><br></h3>



<p>In this country, before you can drive a car, you have to get a license and demonstrate you can responsibly drive a vehicle. Governor Hickenlooper would create that same rite of passage for gun ownership, with two primary elements:<br></p>



<p>First, gun owners will obtain a national gun license based on eligibility requirements including a background check. This license would be renewed online every five years. Gun owners will have a three-year grace period to meeting the licensing requirements.<br></p>



<p>Second, the next generation of gun owners — those turning 21 after the Hickenlooper plan is passed — would need to undergo gun safety and storage training as part of the licensing requirement. Most hunters go through hunter safety classes to obtain a hunting license, so it reasons we should expand this practice across guns that are even more potentially dangerous than a hunting rifle.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Opposing concealed carry reciprocity</strong><br></h3>



<p>For the last two years, Republicans in Congress and the National Rifle Association have pushed concealed carry reciprocity. This legislation would essentially invalidate local gun safety regulations across the country by requiring states and municipalities to recognize concealed carry permits from other states regardless of the requirements it took to get those out-of-state permits. Authorities in major cities with robust gun safety laws would be forced to accept much-less stringent concealed carry permits from very different places. Standards to receive concealed carry permits in Alabama are very different than those in Chicago, but under concealed carry reciprocity, they would be treated the same.<br></p>



<p>As Governor of Colorado, Hickenlooper effectively opposed concealed carry reciprocity legislation. That’s why as President, Hickenlooper will oppose and veto concealed carry reciprocity legislation.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Fund local community-based programs to break the cycle of gun violence in urban areas</strong><br></h3>



<p>Gun violence is devastating to all of our communities, though gun violence is disproportionately high in dense, underserved urban areas, particularly within impoverished communities of color. [2] Hickenlooper knows the only way to address this violence is through a holistic approach: effective gun laws to deal with the flood of guns are part of the solution but we also need to invest in economic development and proven, local community-based strategies and services to reduce the epidemic of gun violence in our communities.<br></p>



<p>These programs will hire individuals from the local communities to participate in Group Violence Intervention, Hospital-based Violence Intervention and other holistic programs that have been proven to work.<br></p>



<p>Local community advocates will provide services that benefit at-risk individuals such as Hickenlooper’s apprenticeship program, mobility assistance, preventive and post-traumatic mental health treatment, and housing support. A person whose basic needs are being met is far less likely to engage in violent behavior. [3]<br></p>



<h3><strong>Replicate the Massachusetts safe storage law</strong><br></h3>



<p>Currently, only Massachusetts has a law requiring that firearms are stored in a locked location. With today’s technology, gun safes are faster to open and easier to access than ever. It’s time for the federal government to require that guns are stored behind a lock. This will prevent children from accessing guns, reduce suicides, and keep our communities safer.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Using data to stop mass shootings</strong><br></h3>



<p>We must leverage technology to strengthen threat assessments. Law enforcement lacks the capacity to do the deep research of every planned, thwarted or executed school attack. This is where public-private partnerships can step in to assist with predictive analytics. In Denver, for example, a remarkable student Shreya Nallapatti was motivated to act after the Parkland shooting. Nallapatti brought together a team of young technologists to analyze historic gun violence to help understand the factors that can be predictive of a mass shooting. [4]<br></p>



<p>In Cincinnati, a research team at the Children’s Hospital Medical Center is using predictive data analysis to assist therapists and counselors in assessing students’ risk for school violence. In the pilot study of 103 students in 74 schools, the machine learning algorithm was highly accurate in assessing school violence risk. [5]<br></p>



<p>During his terms as Mayor and Governor, Hickenlooper set a national model for initiating public-private partnerships to solve big problems and drive innovation. [6] President Hickenlooper would build on that legacy at the federal level including in the technology sector.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Fund CDC research on gun violence</strong><br></h3>



<p>For two decades, Congress has prevented the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), from adequately researching the impact of gun violence and how to prevent gun violence. Congress also hindered research with the Tiahrt Amendment in 2003, which limits ATF’s authority to release gun trace data. Of all the leading causes of death in our country, gun violence receives by far the least amount of research funding. [7]<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper will immediately move to fund the CDC’s research into gun violence prevention and will direct that the CDC’s findings be used in conjunction with solutions to reduce gun violence.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Keeping Firearms in the Right Hands&nbsp;</strong><br></h2>



<h3><strong>National universal background checks</strong></h3>



<p>We need a national system of universal background checks to address the state-by-state patchwork and loopholes. An overwhelming majority of Americans support requiring a background check for all gun sales. Currently, one in five gun purchases are not subject to a background check because of existing loopholes. The nonpartisan Rand Corporation estimates universal background checks could prevent 1,100 homicides a year. As President, Governor Hickenlooper will close this loophole and expand the waiting period to 10 days to eliminate the “Charleston Loophole.”<br></p>



<h3><strong>Raising the age to purchase a firearm to 21</strong><br></h3>



<p>Too many young people have access to guns. By raising the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21, we will reduce intentional, accidental and suicidal gun violence. Florida recently raised the minimum age to 21 (in legislation signed by a Republican governor) and it is time we had a standard, nationwide age restriction on gun purchases.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Stop gun trafficking</strong><br></h3>



<p>Governor Hickenlooper knows law enforcement needs the necessary tools to go after our most dangerous gun criminals — criminals who traffic crime guns with little fear of prosecution. Instead of a common-sense federal gun trafficking law, prosecutors are forced to rely on a patchwork of inconsistent and ineffective state laws. This dangerous omission must be immediately addressed. Just like the RICO Act significantly and permanently weakened the Mafia, we need federal legislation to stop our most dangerous criminals from trafficking guns and endangering our communities.<br></p>



<p>Each year, there are roughly 450,000 instances in which a criminal uses a firearm in a violent crime (i.e., rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault). When law enforcement is able to trace the guns used in these crimes, they have found that in 9 out of 10 cases, the person who originally bought the gun is different from the person who used it. And a third of these guns came from out of state. <br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper strongly supports a federal gun trafficking law to stem the flow of crime guns to our most dangerous criminals. Combined with universal background checks, this new gun trafficking law will make our communities safer by getting guns out of the hands of bad actors who are destroying our neighborhoods.<br></p>



<p>We need to make gun trafficking a federal crime and we can make our communities safer by punishing criminals who sell or transfer guns they know or should reasonably know have been illegally obtained. We also must amend the federal Criminal Code to allow for conspiracy charges against offenders who continue to move guns across state lines to be sold to criminals.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Folding the ATF into the FBI</strong><br></h3>



<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) is one of the federal government’s oldest bureaus. Over time its mission has included oversight of alcohol, tobacco, arms, and explosives, with primary focus on firearms enforcement. Yet, the ATF has never developed a clear mission or foothold among federal law enforcement agencies.<br></p>



<p>While ATF agents are productive and dedicated, their agency has been hobbled by bureaucratic and political obstacles; [8] it has suffered from inadequate oversight and fragmentation from other federal law enforcement agencies. Congress, heavily influenced by the N.R.A., has further compromised the agency by preventing its director from being confirmed and imposing limitations that prevent the agency from implementing the simplest of measures to track the ownership of firearms. [9] It struggles to perform basic duties, including inspections of firearms dealers and the tracking of gun-related crimes.<br></p>



<p>Nine out of ten guns used in crimes come from only 5% of gun dealers. While the ATF is aware of who these gun dealers are, it has responded with alarming leniency and allowed many of the worst offenders to keep their licenses. [10]<br></p>



<p>Extraordinary cooperation is required to tackle the multi-jurisdictional and complex epidemic of gun crime, with more than 300 million guns in private hands in the US It’s time that the ATF and its mission, agents, and staff, are transferred into the FBI, the law enforcement agency whose mission is “to uphold and enforce the criminal laws of the United States.” [11] This move would give agents stability, prevent agencies from competing over the same cases, and finally put firearms crimes in the same standing as other offenses.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Grants to encourage states to implement extreme risk protection orders</strong><br></h3>



<p>Colorado and fourteen other states have Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws on the books. These laws let families and law enforcement temporarily remove an individual’s access to firearms in order to prevent future acts of violence. This type of state-level legislation needs to be incentivized. We also need to make sure individuals under ERPOs cannot pass background checks to obtain firearms. As President, Hickenlooper will create a grant program to help states give local law enforcement the resources they need to implement extreme risk protection orders.<br></p>



<p>ERPO laws aren’t just a way to stop mass shootings. Studies have shown that they are an effective tool at reducing suicides. ERPO laws give loved ones a civil option to intervene on warning signs and prevent tragedies from occurring. It’s time the federal government helps put them in place across the country.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Eliminating Weapons of War</strong> <br></h2>



<h3><strong>National magazine limits</strong></h3>



<p>Governor Hickenlooper passed magazine limits in Colorado and he supports magazine limits nationwide; 155% more people are shot in incidents where assault weapons or high-capacity magazines are used. [12]<br></p>



<p>Magazine limits save lives during mass shootings and responsible hunters and gun owners agree that high-capacity magazines serve little purpose other than turning firearms into weapons of war.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Codifying the ban on bump stocks</strong><br></h3>



<p>After the tragic Las Vegas shooting in 2017, the DOJ reinterpreted a long-standing rule to effectively ban bump stocks. These and other similar accessories essentially turn legal firearms into automatic weapons. It’s time for Congress to affirm that interpretation and codify it into law. We must act to permanently ban these lethal accessories.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Banning the sale of silencers</strong><br></h3>



<p>Silencers suppress the noise from gunfire and cover the muzzle flash. They make it more difficult for potential witnesses and law enforcement to locate gunfire. Currently, silencers must be registered with the ATF, but eight states and the District of Columbia have banned them despite the federal registry. The federal should ban silencers because they enable criminals, make the jobs of law enforcement harder, and do not serve the overall public good.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Bringing back the assault weapons ban</strong><br></h3>



<p>Assault weapons are responsible for one out of five police deaths. [13] Mass shootings involving assault weapons or high-capacity magazines lead to an average of 155% more injuries. [14] Assault weapons were used in many of our nation’s most deadly mass shootings including those at the Las Vegas Harvest Music Festival, Sandy Hook Elementary School, and the Aurora Theater. It’s time for Congress to enact a meaningful and effective assault weapons ban that builds on the previous legislation that expired in 2004. If the original ban had not been allowed to lapse, fewer assault weapons would be on the streets, mass shootings would be less devastating, and our law enforcement would be safer.<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper would support and sign into law the Assault Weapons Ban of 2019 (S.66), introduced by Senators Feinstein, Murphy and Blumenthal that thoughtfully addresses many of the ways the gun industry found to evade the prior law while also providing exemptions for 2,200 guns for hunting, household defense or recreational purposes.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Outlaw the manufacture <em>of ghost guns and 3-D printed guns</em></strong><br></h3>



<p>3D printing has opened the door for new dangerous firearms. Printable guns are untraceable and often made with so little metal that even metal detectors fail to notice them. Meanwhile, other firearms are easily assembled from kits that can be ordered online. These guns also provide a convenient way for criminals to get around the background check system or to produce illegal firearms. These printed firearms also make it difficult for law enforcement because traditionally they can track where a firearm was produced and first sold based on the gun’s serial number. It’s time the federal government bans the creation of these firearms and works harder to prevent the proliferation of the plans to print them.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Keeping Our Schools Safe</strong><br></h2>



<h3><strong>Prevent gun violence in our schools</strong><br></h3>



<p>We need a comprehensive effort to strengthen prevention in the epidemic of school shootings. This is a recurring tragedy that has taken too many lives of our young people and traumatized millions more. We applaud the bravery of our students and educators and first-responders, but we need to do more to keep them safe. Governor Hickenlooper supports actions to:<br></p>



<h3><strong>Expand access to mental health services in our schools and communities</strong><br></h3>



<p>While people living with mental illness are more likely to be victims of violence than perpetrators, and we must be mindful not to perpetuate stigmas that create barriers or prevent access to care, any comprehensive strategy to prevent gun violence must include mental health supports. Fewer than one out of six children (16%) receive any mental health services.<br></p>



<p>Untreated or poorly managed childhood mental health disorders have significant consequences not only for the child and family but also for a range of systems, including healthcare, child welfare, and juvenile justice systems and public education.<br></p>



<p>The expansion of Medicaid has increased the funding available to Medicaid managed care programs and community health centers to broaden and better integrate behavioral health services.<br></p>



<p>President Trump has proposed deep, devastating cuts in Medicaid funding, the single largest funder of mental health services in the country. President Hickenlooper would lead in the opposite direction, recognizing the critical importance of all sources of federal funding for mental health services including federal matches of state Medicaid and CHIP spending and Mental Health Block Grants that support community mental health services to fully fund and support quality, innovation and universal access to mental health services.<br></p>



<p>Additionally, President Hickenlooper would seek to leverage and direct Medicaid funds toward preventive behavioral health integration in pediatric primary care and school- based health centers. President Hickenlooper would overhaul payments for children’s healthcare so that quality and outcomes are rewarded — rather than the quantity of care delivered — which would have a positive impact on children’s health.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Establish threat assessment teams nationwide</strong><br></h3>



<p>Launch a “national program to train and support school- and community-based threat assessment teams that include mental health and law enforcement partners. Threat assessment programs should include practical channels of communication for persons to report potential threats as well as interventions to resolve conflicts and assist troubled individuals.” [15]<br></p>



<h3><strong>Bring Colorado’s Successful “Safe 2 Tell” Program to Every School</strong><br></h3>



<p>The Safe 2 Tell program in Colorado is an anonymous way for students, parents, teachers and community members to report safety concerns. It is similar to the federal Crime Stoppers program, but school and youth focused. The program has an anonymous phone line, app, and website that allow people to report their concerns whenever and however they think is best. The program has been wildly successful in Colorado leading to thousands of reports. Each year concerns about suicides, bullying, substance abuse, planned attacks, domestic abuse, child abuse, and many more are reported. The program is centered around informing youth that this is a safe way for them to report concerns without fear of punishment. As President, John Hickenlooper will work with states to create a national Safe 2 Tell program so that we can prevent tragedies everywhere.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Long term support for survivors and first responders</strong><br></h3>



<p>While federal funding is currently provided to support survivors and victims’ families in the immediate aftermath of a mass shooting, the terrible recent losses make clear those resources need to be available long-term. We need to provide trauma-informed care and ongoing support for victims based on a clinical assessment of need.</p>



<p></p>



<h2><strong>Liability for Manufacturers and Dealers</strong><br></h2>



<h3><strong>Repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)</strong><br></h3>



<p>In 2005, Congress shielded gun manufacturers from liability. This protection allows gun manufacturers to ignore basic preventive measures to avoid gun traffickers, disincentives them to correct and recall defective and potentially products, and to avoid risky distributors and dealers. The PLCAA needs to be repealed to put gun manufacturers in the same category as every other business. No private enterprise should be immune from liability.<br></p>

<p>As Governor of Colorado, John Hickenlooper oversaw an innovative, comprehensive plan that significantly expanded access to long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) for women. LARC is highly reliable and requires a one-time doctor’s visit to ensure long-term birth control, making it more convenient and effective than low-cost methods like the pill. But for too long LARC’s high cost and lack of accessibility has kept this method of birth control out of reach for many women who want it.<br></p>



<p>In contrast to Alabama and the numerous other states currently pushing to restrict abortion, Colorado respected women’s reproductive rights and expanded options for all women — regardless of age, income or geography. The result? Colorado saw a 64% drop in abortions and 54% drop in unintended pregnancies among young women. [1] They also realized over $70 million in savings to the state budget. [2]<br></p>



<p>As President, Governor Hickenlooper would expand Colorado’s successful LARC program nationally — closing the gap for women who currently cannot afford or do not have access to LARC. Governor Hickenlooper believes we must protect the right of all women, regardless of income, geography, race or ethnicity, to control their own bodies. Governor Hickenlooper is committed to ensuring that every woman has access to the full range of contraceptive options, so she can choose the method that best fits her needs and preferences, and that providers are educated and trained to provide the full range of options in a way that respects decision- making and autonomy.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Background: The Colorado LARC Program — Access, Affordability &amp; Education</strong><br></h3>



<p>A centerpiece of the Colorado effort was to eliminate barriers to long acting reversible contraception (LARC), making it accessible and affordable to all women. LARCs offer a one-time appointment for safe and effective contraception — and consequently have an effectiveness rate of over 99%. [3] But too often, women do not have access to these life-changing options. In addition to the significant cost of LARC for those women not covered by insurance, not all clinics or healthcare providers offer LARC. For women in rural communities, the distance required to reach a provider who offered LARC could be prohibitive. Low-income women with unpredictable work or childcare schedules faced similar hurdles. [4]<br></p>



<p>An important element of the Colorado program’s success was its comprehensiveness and commitment to universal access. In addition to funding for LARC purchases, the initiative trained healthcare providers to offer LARC, and provided operational support for family planning clinics that enabled upgrades to equipment and billing procedures, added sites and increased hours; and provided support with community outreach. Enhancing the success of the program was a statewide public awareness campaign to educate young people about the importance of reproductive health and increase the visibility of family planning clinics and other health centers offering affordable reproductive health services. Colorado has minor consent, which allows a teen, no matter her age, to consent for her own contraceptive methods and procedures. [5]<br></p>



<p>The result of this effort to increase awareness, affordability and accessibility of LARCs: </p>



<ul><li>Reduced the teen pregnancy rate by 54% [6]</li><li>Reduced Colorado’s teen abortion rate by 64%, [7] and</li><li>Saved the state $70 million over five years in averted public assistance costs [8]</li></ul>



<p>Despite this success, the LARC program originally faced significant partisan opposition in a politically divided, purple state. [9] Initially, the program was funded by a mix of public and private foundation funding but Governor Hickenlooper demonstrated the leadership to overcome partisan objections and earn the bipartisan support [10] necessary to make this a publicly funded, fully sustainable program.</p>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Expanding Colorado’s LARC Program nationally</strong><br></h3>



<p>In light of the systemic attack on women’s reproductive rights in states across the country, a federal program which expands access to affordable effective contraception is even more necessary than when Colorado’s LARC program began ten years ago. As President, Hickenlooper would subsidize the cost of LARCs for women who cannot afford it — and dramatically expand access to LARC for all American women who desire such method.<br></p>



<p>While Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act have made LARCs more affordable for millions of Americans, millions of women still fall into an insurance coverage gap. One in five American women with incomes under 200% of the FPL are uninsured. Women of color are at even greater risk of being uninsured, making up three quarters of all uninsured women. [11] And for four in 10 women who obtain their contraceptive care from a safety-net family planning center that focuses on reproductive health, that provider is their only source of care. [12]<br></p>



<p>Even for women who are covered by Medicaid, challenges remain. For example, differences in state programs may mean that women still face high costs and several state Medicaid programs “do not specify coverage for removal of LARC devices or follow-up care.” [13] Further, even for women whose Medicaid or private insurance covers LARC, there are still major barriers to access — either because their health provider does not have adequate training or equipment, or because women are not educated on the benefits of LARC.<br></p>



<p>It’s clear that a stronger federal role is required to ensure comprehensive family planning services for all women. As President, John Hickenlooper would increase Title X funding by $700 million to ensure that all women have access to family planning care. [14] Colorado has demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of expanded access to family planning services, achieving a savings of $5.85 in Medicaid costs alone for every dollar invested in the LARC initiative. [15]<br></p>



<p>Title X funding provides comprehensive family services to all who want and need them, with priority given to clients with low-income. Title X funding supports 4,000 health centers nationally and serves four million clients annually. Two-thirds of the clients served by Title X funding are below the federal poverty level, and nearly half are uninsured, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. [16] President Trump has proposed to undermine the Title X program through funding rollbacks and onerous restrictions.<br></p>



<p>In addition to subsidizing the cost of LARC, Hickenlooper’s plan would expand access to LARC nationally. As a first step, the Governor would repeal the Trump Administration’s domestic gag rule, which bans vital organizations like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Title X funding.<br></p>



<p>Next, the Governor would appropriate additional funds to ensure that more doctors and healthcare providers are sufficiently trained to offer LARC as part of their practices; and provide operational support for family planning clinics to upgrade equipment and billing procedures, add sites and increase hours; and provide support with community outreach. Hickenlooper’s plan would also fund a public education campaign that dramatically raises awareness of LARC’s benefits and provides training to professionals to ensure that they respect women’s preferences and needs for contraceptive options. Funding is critical not only for LARC access but also to ensure removal for women who desire to discontinue using their LARC.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Governor, John Hickenlooper took Colorado from 40th in job growth to the number one economy in America, according to US News &amp; World Report. [1] Part of the secret to Colorado’s new economic strength is trade; Colorado now exports over $8 billion in goods each year, accounting for over 40,000 jobs. Hickenlooper understands how trade — when done right — can benefit our farmers, entrepreneurs, technology companies, aerospace sector, and many other areas where America continues to lead the world in innovation.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper rejects the idea of demonizing the private sector to score political points, and instead issues a clarion call for rebooting American capitalism, so that it produces both greater economic equality and greater economic growth. His plan ensures open and fair trade, in a way that benefits American workers, employers, investors, and national security interests.<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper will launch a new set of policies to ensure open and fair trade for America. His plan for trade includes five key elements:</p>



<ol><li>Ensure trading partners adopt and enforce fair labor and safety standards Ensure the protection of IP rights of American companies</li><li>Require trading partners to enforce environmental and climate standards </li><li>Ensure US firms enjoy equitable and comparable investment rights abroad Ensure US workers have assistance to adjust to job displacement from trade</li></ol>



<p>At a time when our president and many leaders in both parties are pursuing steps to restrict trade, Hickenlooper believes we must expand trade, on fair terms, in order to have a growing economy. The United States has gained enormously from the structure of alliances and trading networks it helped build and lead in the decades succeeding World War II. Ninety-five percent of the world’s consumers now live outside the US. [2] Our country’s global trade supports 41 million US jobs. [3] Export-led growth, if conducted fairly, can lower consumer prices, raises wages, and increase demand for US goods.<br></p>



<p>One of Donald Trump’s most harmful and short-sighted actions has been to launch tariff wars and walk away from trade agreements that held the promise of growing our economy, creating good jobs, and deepening security ties with friends and allies around the world. Rather than cooperatively working with foreign friends and allies to improve the terms of trade, he has unilaterally attacked the global trading system, with dire consequences for our country:</p>



<ul><li>Trump’s own Department of Agriculture estimates that the on-going tariff war will have an $11 billion negative impact on US agriculture. [4]</li><li>US farmers in the Midwest are filing for chapter 12 bankruptcy protection at the highest levels in a decade. In seven Midwestern rural states, including Iowa, farm bankruptcies in 2018 were almost double the amount from 2008. [5]</li><li>The US lost out on an estimated $131 billion increase in annual real incomes, or .5% of GDP, due to failure to secure a trade deal with Pacific trading partners. [6]</li><li>Researches at Iowa State University estimate that Iowa’s overall losses in the agricultural industry will exceed $1 billion in 2018 alone from trade disruptions linked to tariffs. [7]</li><li>The global trade war set off by Trump’s tariffs is devastating the dairy industry in Wisconsin and around the nation. The US Dairy Export Council estimates that over the next several years, retaliatory tariffs by Mexico and China could cost dairy farmers $16.6 billion in lost revenues. [8]</li></ul>



<p>Trump’s destructive policies on trade, and the proposals of other anti-trade leaders, also threaten to undermine America’s national security. As the US has pulled out of potential trade- expanding agreements, it has reduced our own ability to get help from friends and allies to address major challenges, from China’s unfair trade practices, to North Korea’s nuclear program, to Russia’s bullying of its neighbors, to efforts to stem illegal immigration into our country.<br></p>



<p>By contrast, Hickenlooper’s trade plan — in conjunction with his broad economic strategy — will ensure more growth, opportunity, and fairness for the American people. Hickenlooper understands that being absent from economic opportunity anywhere in our interconnected world is not an option. He believes open and fair trade is achievable, and essential to the prosperity and security of the American people.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Ensure labor and safety rights as part of any trade agreement</strong><br></h3>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper will ensure that labor and safety standards in any trade agreement are set at the highest levels, and equally observed and enforced across all parties. This would ensure that no country that is a party to a trade agreement with the US is able to restrict the right for labor to organize, use child labor in its factories, force workers to work in unsafe conditions, or otherwise gain competitive advantage against US workers by mistreating their own workers.<br></p>



<p>Specifically, any trade agreements entered into by a Hickenlooper administration will ensure that:</p>



<ul><li>Labor and safety standards, and strong enforcement of the standards, are a precondition for new trade deals</li><li>A process exists to enable these standards to evolve and improve across the trading bloc over time</li><li>Bilateral enforcement mechanisms are established, where complaints can be addressed in a timely manner</li><li>Penalties for non-observance are significant, and can include withdrawal of trading benefits</li><li>Parties to trade agreements are limited in importing materials or product from countries which do not observe adequate labor and safety standards for export to the US, and that real enforcement mechanisms exist.</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Ensure the protection of IP rights of US companies</strong></h3>



<p>Intellectual property (IP) is a key American resource. Over 40 million US jobs are in “IP-intensive” industries, and these industries represent among the most competitive of our businesses internationally. These industries also tend to pay higher wages and drive almost 60% of US merchandise exports. Protecting the IP behind these jobs will be a critical component of Hickenlooper’s Open and Fair Trade Policy.<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper will ensure that his open and fair trade policy:</p>



<ul><li>Provides strong protections for US firms’ patent, copyrights, and trademarks</li><li>Provides strong penalties for theft of American IP, including by cyber theft</li><li>Prohibits the importation or sale of counterfeit products</li><li>Ensures IP protections across all countries are easily obtained and enforced, and that noncompliance penalties are strict, including withdrawal of trading privileges</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Require enforcement of environmental and climate change standards</strong><br></h3>



<p>Hickenlooper believes open and fair trade cannot come at the expense of America’s or the planet’s environment. Hickenlooper will particularly incorporate climate change goals into our trade agreements. The success of the planet’s efforts to combat climate change ultimately depend on international cooperation; we cannot do it alone. Previous trade agreements have too often ignored or underplayed climate change and greenhouse gas emissions as a multilateral problem. As part of his administration’s open and fair trade policy, Hickenlooper will:</p>



<ul><li>Ensure greenhouse gas emission goals to combat global warming are set and enforced as part of any trade policy</li><li>Ensure that overall environmental standards, including adequate protections for clean air and water are included in any trade agreements</li><li>Make enforcement mechanisms transparent and efficient, and have sufficiently severe penalties for noncompliance, including withdrawal of trade privileges</li><li>Ensure that parties to the trade treaty are limited in importing materials or product from countries which do not observe adequate environmental standards, and then exporting those to the US, and that real enforcement mechanisms exist in enforcing this.</li><li>Ensure US Companies’ Investment Rights are Protected and Equitable</li></ul>



<p>Open and fair trade requires US companies and individuals to be able to invest across geographies. Some countries have unfairly constrained US firms from investing in their markets, even as they enjoy virtually unrestricted access to US markets. As President, Hickenlooper will ensure that:</p>



<ul><li>The rights of American companies to invest, acquire, divest and gain market access are protected and equitable to those of foreign companies</li><li>National security exceptions to this policy are well defined and cannot be abused or misused for political purposes</li><li>Enforcement mechanisms are efficient and transparent</li></ul>



<p></p>



<h3><strong>Ensure US assistance for US workers to ensure skills and mobility</strong><br></h3>



<p>Hickenlooper’s open and fair trade policies will broadly increase growth and prosperity for American workers, employers, and investors. At the same time, Hickenlooper knows that trade can inevitably result in disruptions and losses for specific workers. He believes past US trade policies have done far too little to ensure American workers have the skills and mobility they need to move to new and better jobs — both generally, and in the specific context of trade displacement. Therefore, his open and fair trade policy includes a new set of policies that will provide federal assistance to workers preparing for jobs of the future and responding to changes caused by global trade:<br></p>



<p><strong>Individual Security Accounts.</strong> Hickenlooper will create a new system of Individual Security Accounts — “ISAs” — which are mobile accounts tied to individuals, funded pre-tax with a combination of government, worker and employer contributions, with continuing employer and employee contributions similar to current IRAs. Hickenlooper believes workers should be investing in improving their skills 3–5 years ahead of any job change, and ISAs will make that possible for all workers, including those who feel their jobs are at risk due to trade-related changes. ISAs could to be used at any time for retraining or relocation in case of job loss, or folded into traditional IRAs on retirement</p>



<p><strong>Additional assistance for trade-impacted areas.</strong> The Secretary of Labor will designate geographic areas adversely affected by trade displacement. Residents in such areas will be able to devote more pre-tax funds to their ISAs, in order to help fund their training, relocation, and other steps related to adjustment.</p>



<p>Hickenlooper’s broader economic program includes policies that will also make it easier for workers to adjust to changing employment patterns, including free community college for those who cannot afford tuition, and universal coverage, so that workers can change jobs without fear of losing insurance.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>John Hickenlooper wants to ensure America’s economy does more to reward work, reduce income inequality, and promote opportunity for young people and entrepreneurs. At the heart of his “Strategy for a Working America” is a determination to revise the federal tax code so it does more to reward work, and less to unduly favor those who earn their income from passive investment.<br></p>



<p>Two major tax-related initiatives designed to reorient the federal tax code to these twin goals of economic equality and economic growth:</p>



<ol><li>A major expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, with roughly a doubling of the existing benefit, and reforms to ensure that this refundable tax credit is fully available to working tax filers who do not have children living at home.</li><li>Ending most aspects of the privileged tax treatment of long-term capital gains, so that these sources of income will be taxed as ordinary income in most cases; the reform includes ending provisions that now allow the wealthy to pass on stock portfolios and other assets with no long- term capital gains taxes at death.</li></ol>



<p>The American economy over past decades has been a starkly divided picture. For working Americans, it has been a picture of relative stagnation. Real wages have barely increased since the mid-1970s, despite overall growth in the economy.<br></p>



<p>The picture is quite different for the best-off Americans. The share of American income going to the top 1% of Americans has now returned to levels that have not been seen since the “Roaring Twenties,” just before the Great Depression. [1] Since the 1990s, the gains for those at the top have been mostly driven by income derived from capital, rather than from wage gains.<br></p>



<p>According to former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, if the United States had the same income distribution it had in 1979, the bottom 80% of the population would have an average of $11,000 more per family than they do today. [2]<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper seeks to end this divided and inequitable picture. His “Strategy for a Working America” seeks to reward work and reduce historic income inequality with two major tax changes.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Increase and improve the Earned Income Tax Credit</strong><br></h3>



<p>First, the strategy would significantly increase and improve the federal Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC — which is refundable and administered entirely through the tax code — has proved to be one of the country’s strongest, best-targeted, and most efficient ways to combat poverty and ensure a decent income for those who work.<br></p>



<p>Because of the importance of this program, as Governor, Hickenlooper proposed roughly a doubling of Colorado’s state match to the EITC.<br></p>



<p>Yet the federal EITC currently does not provide enough tax relief to ensure that all working households receive a decent income, above the poverty line. Part of the problem is that the credit is limited for households that do not have children living at home.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper’s proposal is broadly similar to the recently-introduced “Grow American Incomes Now” (GAIN) Act, introduced in 2017 by Senator Sherrod Brown and Representative Ro Khanna. As in GAIN, Hickenlooper’s proposal would</p>



<ul><li>Roughly double the EITC for households with children.</li><li>Raise the maximum benefit for households that do not have children living at home, resulting in approximately a six-fold increase in benefits for the average childless recipient household.</li><li>Reduce the minimum qualifying age for workers not raising children in their home from 25 to 21 and increase the credit’s income limit.</li></ul>



<p>The proposal would benefit a broad range of working households. Under the reform, the EITC would benefit childless couples with incomes up to $42,700 (in 2017 dollars), and married couples with a child with incomes up to $64,800.<br></p>



<p>According to analysis by the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, this set of changes would have a dramatic effect on the incomes of working Americans. It would increase the incomes of 47 million working families and individuals, including 21 million who would become newly eligible for the credit. The average benefit across these individuals would be $2,800. [3]<br></p>



<p>In addition to reducing income inequality, expanding the EITC is a pro-growth reform. It will place more income in the hands of working families, who spend more of their income on consumption than upper-income households. This means the reform will help boost consumer demand, which is a key driver of economic growth.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Tax long-term capital gains as ordinary income in most cases</strong><br></h3>



<p>The second major tax change in Hickenlooper’s “Strategy for a Working America” would end the advantaged tax treatment of long-term capital gains. Currently, the federal tax code taxes ordinary income at rates of up to 37%; but taxation of income derived from long-term capital gains is capped at 21%.<br></p>



<p>This provision rewards those who benefit from passive investments (e.g., the rise in value of stocks, appreciation in value of artwork, etc.) more than those who draw their income from a weekly paycheck. It is one of the primary drivers of the country’s historic income and wealth inequality; nearly 80% of the benefits from lower taxes on capital gains go to the top 1%. [4] The advantaged taxation of capital gains is also one of the tax code’s key drivers of complexity tax avoidance strategies.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper’s proposal would:</p>



<ul><li>Treat dividends and long-term capital gains as ordinary income for tax purposes. Long-term capital gains linked to small businesses, primary residences, and retirement accounts would be excluded.</li><li>Adjust taxable long-term gains for each eligible asset to account for inflation (as measured by the consumer price index) for the period over which the asset was held. In other words, a taxpayer realizing a $100 capital gain on an asset held for one year, during which inflation was 5%, would pay tax on $95.23 (= $100 / 1.05).</li><li>End the exclusion on taxation of capital gains at death and other transfers, which is one of the primary ways that upper-income households escape taxation on their gains. His proposal would value and tax such gains as ordinary income upon the death of the taxpayer and upon other transfers.</li></ul>



<p>Hickenlooper’s proposal would not include the “mark-to-market” concept proposed by some as a reform of the taxation of capital gains, due to the complexities and enforcement difficulties this concept would introduce.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A thriving economy can’t exist without properly funded infrastructure. As Mayor of Denver, John Hickenlooper brought Republican and Democratic Mayors together to pass the largest expansion of expansion of light rail in modern American history. [1] As Governor, Hickenlooper brought together lawmakers from both parties to pass a plan to bring all of Colorado’s 64 counties reliable broadband service. [2]<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper’s plan for America’s infrastructure revolves around a trillion-dollar federal investment in infrastructure, with a particularly strong emphasis on:</p>



<ul><li>Clean energy initiatives and projects designed to reduce traffic, create more multi-modal options, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</li><li>Major investments in rural areas so that every community regardless of where has access to reliable broadband service.</li></ul>



<p>These investments will be paid for in part by a partial repeal of the Trump-Ryan tax cut. The Governor will also incentivize the types of private-public partnerships that have given birth to so many urban revitalization projects across the country, including Lower Downtown Denver.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Historic green jobs program</strong><br></h3>



<p>Green jobs are the jobs of the future for every community. Colorado now has as many clean energy jobs as extraction jobs, and solar, wind, and energy efficiency jobs are one of the state’s fastest growing jobs sectors. Under Hickenlooper’s leadership, all 64 counties in Colorado saw tremendous growth in clean energy. In Colorado, it’s now cheaper to produce renewable energy than any other type. Coal-fired power plants there are closing and being replaced with renewables.<br></p>



<p>Hickenlooper wants to invest in clean energy job growth and address our massive need for more multimodal transportation in cities. That’s why this plan will not only include funding for our backlog of transportation projects, but $200 billion will be set aside to revolutionize our transportation network and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Hickenlooper will also spend $150 million upgrading America’s electric grid to be more efficient and better equipped to utilize our massive renewable energy growth.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Expansion of BUILD grants</strong><br></h3>



<p>As Mayor of Denver and Governor of Colorado, Hickenlooper has helped put federal grant dollars to use on high priority projects. Without those federal dollars, some of Colorado’s most important infrastructure projects never would have become a reality. The BUILD grant program has become such an in-demand pot of money for local projects that just 5% of applicants received funding in 2017. With an expansion of these grants, more states could receive funding for their most vital projects. Hickenlooper’s plan would include a massive expansion of the program to $5 billion annually.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Stabilizing the Highway Trust Fund</strong><br></h3>



<p>Congress has failed to stabilize funding for the Highway Trust Fund leading to record unmet infrastructure repairs. America has an estimated 47,000 structurally deficient bridges, countless miles of highway in need of repair, and thousands of buses and trains that will soon reach the end of their lifespans. [3] Hickenlooper’s plan will stabilize the trust fund with an additional $200 billion in funding over the next ten years.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Addressing America’s public lands maintenance backlog</strong><br></h3>



<p>Despite national parks having historic numbers of visitors last year, there are nearly $20 billion in deferred maintenance costs across the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, US Fish and Wildlife Service and US Forest Service. Hickenlooper’s plan would include $20 billion in funding to address those deferred needs.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Eliminating lead in water</strong><br></h3>



<p>Nearly 5,000 US water systems that provide service to roughly 18 million people violate the EPA’s rules for lead water concentrations. There is no excuse for Americans to not have safe drinking water. One of the main reasons for this problem is that many municipal lines connecting to homes have not been brought up to federal standards. Under the plan, the federal government would spend $30 billion to remediate and replace these lines so that no community has lead in their drinking water.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Updating and replacing water and sewage treatment systems</strong><br></h3>



<p>Over the next twenty years, municipalities will be facing over $600 billion in costs to replace water and sewage treatment plants. Under the plan, the federal government would set aside $130 billion for these projects including money to expand grant access for individual septic system replacements in rural counties.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Fixing the FAA’s project backlog</strong><br></h3>



<p>Over the next ten years, the Federal Aviation Administration will have a nearly $20 billion budget shortfall for upcoming projects. We will add an additional $20 billion to the FAA’s annual facilities and equipment budget, the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) so that our airports stay efficient and our skies are safe.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Rural broadband</strong><br></h3>



<p>Today’s economy requires reliable broadband access. Too many rural communities are falling behind because their residents do not have access to the internet. In Colorado, Hickenlooper passed a plan to get reliable broadband access to all of Colorado’s 64 counties. As President, he will fund $20 billion for that purpose resulting in near universal access to rural broadband within the continental United States. This will help communities connect into today’s economy and help keep our rural counties open for business. [4]<br></p>



<h3><strong>Repairing America’s public schools</strong><br></h3>



<p>Hickenlooper’s plan will also include $130 billion to meet the infrastructure needs of public schools. The federal government needs to step up and help municipalities and states address the growing crisis of underfunded public schools. Too many students are in classrooms without heat or air conditioning, and local school districts do not have the funds to address these needs.<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The federal minimum wage is a vital tool to ensure livable wages for full-time workers. The last federal minimum wage increase occurred almost ten years ago in July 2009, and we are past due for an increase.<br></p>



<p>When Governor Hickenlooper supported a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage in Colorado, he said, “I’m not sure there’s another way to help move more people out of poverty than to raise the minimum wage… I think in this county, if you work 40 hours a week, and you work hard you ought to be able to afford an apartment.” [1]<br></p>



<p>A single parent making the federal minimum wage and working full-time would make $15,080 annually, an amount that is below the poverty line for a family of two. [2] Every 10% increase in minimum wage reduces poverty rates in the African-American and Hispanic communities by 10.9% [3] and would reduce the number of people living in poverty by 2.4%. [4]<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper will raise the minimum wage to a nationwide floor of $15/hour by 2024, and he will also permanently tie the minimum wage to cost of living. Moving forward, the minimum wage must always be a living wage. In some high cost-of-living areas today, we need to go even higher than $15/hour in the very near future.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Setting a nationwide floor of $15/hour</strong><br></h3>



<p>Large metropolitan areas and geographies with higher costs of living will be moved to $15/hour by 2021, followed by mid-size and mid-costs cities and then finally all communities nationwide will be at $15/hour by 2024. </p>



<ul><li>MSAs in the top 25th percentile of cost-of-living based on RPP data will transition to $15/hour by 2021</li><li>MSAs in the second 25th percentile of cost-of-living based on RPP data will transition to $15/hour by 2022</li><li>MSAs in the third 25th percentile of cost-of-living based on RPP data will transition to $15/hour by 2023</li><li>MSAs in the fourth 25th percentile of cost-of-living based on RPP data will transition to $15/hour by 2024</li></ul>



<p>Regional Price Parities (RPP) is an index that measures the differences across regions in the prices of goods and services. In other words, it’s a measure of comparative purchasing power across MSAs, determined by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.<br></p>



<h3><strong>Tying the minimum wage to cost of living</strong><br></h3>



<p>Hickenlooper will index the minimum wage to an area’s cost of living, guaranteeing that the minimum wage will rise in conjunction with the increased prices of goods and services. We must never again allow the minimum wage to lag so far behind productivity, keeping millions of hard-working Americans in poverty.<br></p>



<p>Data from the Department of Commerce, specifically the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Economic Analysis, will be used to determine the appropriate peg for the minimum wage increases going forward.</p>



<ul><li>Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs, as designated by the US Census) would be sorted into four groups based on their most recent RPP data.</li><li>Every three years the minimum wage would be adjusted, tracking changes in the prices of regional goods and services, based on increases in the average hourly wage of private sector, non-supervisory workers — modeling a similar bill that US Rep. Terri Sewell (AL-07) recently introduced in the House.</li></ul>



<p>Seventeen states currently index their minimum wage based on cost of living increases and/or consumer price index increases. [5]<br></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Small business is one of the great engines of the American economy. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses (which SBA defines under 500 employees) account for 65.9% of net new jobs created from 2000–2017 and comprise 41.1% of private sector payroll. [1]<br></p>



<p>Yet America’s startup economy is slowing down. Fewer people are deciding to become entrepreneurs. [2] According to the Census Bureau, 414,000 startup firms created 2.5 million new jobs in 2015, below the average in the 2002–2006 period of 524,000 startup firms and 3.3 million new jobs per year.<br></p>



<p>The peak was in 2006, when 558,000 startup firms created 3.4 million jobs. [3] Simply returning to those 2006 levels of American innovation would result in 150,000 new startups and 900,000 additional jobs compared to our current track. [4] Hickenlooper believes that, with the right policies and leadership, it is possible to spur multiples of that kind of expansion of entrepreneurship and start-ups.<br></p>



<p>The decline in start-ups in recent years is partly due to the rise of competition-strangling mega- firms in many sectors after decades of erosion in antitrust enforcement. America’s two largest hardware stores now control 80% of market share. Currently, four companies control 98% of the cell phone service provider market share. Fully 56% of all e-commerce is controlled by Amazon and eBay. Even America’s beer industry is 75% controlled by just three companies.<br></p>



<p>Such market domination creates opportunities for sector giants to undercut competition from small business in numerous ways, from locking them out of supply chains, to outright buy-outs of potential new entrants in the sector. Monopolistic companies also use tactics such as non- compete agreements to prevent employees in their sectors from starting their own firms. Nearly one in five American workers are subject to non-compete clauses, and research shows that states with enforceable non-compete agreements have lower rates of within-industry entrepreneurship. [5] [6] One study finds that enforceable non-compete agreements may lead to an 18% reduction in new firms in knowledge-intense fields.<br></p>



<p>America’s entrepreneurs also face an adverse federal incentive structure. A series of federal policies subject small firms to major new costs and regulations (e.g., on the federal minimum wage, healthcare coverage, unpaid leave) once they pass a certain threshold (e.g., 50 employees). Yet there are few federal provisions to help small businesses overcome such “cliffs” and scale their businesses. [7] Partly due to such asymmetrical policies, the chances that a new company can grow to $10 million of revenue by its fifth year are around 0.5%, according to a 2015 Deloitte study. [8]<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper will address the rise of market domination by strengthening anti- trust laws and by providing additional federal support to small businesses in order to grow, particularly in rural areas. <br></p>



<p><strong><em>Colorado record</em></strong></p>



<p>This set of policies flows from John Hickenlooper’s life experiences. John Hickenlooper moved to Colorado in 1981 to pursue a career in geology. In 1986, due to a downturn and changing economy, John and thousands of other geologists to lost not only their jobs, but their profession. John was out of work for two years. In 1987, he and some friends decided to start their own business. Using a library book on how to write a business plan and cobbling together loans from the local government and family and friends, they opened a brewpub in an abandoned warehouse district. Rent was cheap in this forgotten corner of Denver, costing only one dollar per square foot per year. John worked with other small businesses to create a dynamic, new neighborhood that became a national model for urban revitalization — now known as LoDo. John ultimately opened 15 brewpubs and restaurants, almost all in historic buildings, mostly across the Midwest. As he did in Denver, he worked closely with other businesses, nonprofits and local governments to help revitalize the downtowns around each of his brewpubs. Hickenlooper saw how small businesses can transform a community, and he is committed to their strong growth as president.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Changing the focus on antitrust laws</em></strong><br></p>



<p>In the late 1970s, the so-called “Chicago School” began to undermine the role of antitrust laws in protecting upstart businesses from unfair competition. This school of thought posited that antitrust intervention was more likely to harm consumers — to take actions that were “false positives” in their words — than to protect consumers by enabling competition. In a range of areas, including the rules of predatory pricing and what constitutes monopoly conduct, the Chicago School approach gutted the effectiveness of antitrust law. By picking antitrust enforcers who espoused this approach, and by picking judges who championed it, our antitrust laws are no longer working effectively on behalf of consumers and entrepreneurs.<br></p>



<p>The results of the Chicago School agenda are in and they are a more concentrated economy, a harder environment for entrepreneurs to build businesses, and a more difficult environment for consumers and workers. As President, Hickenlooper would:</p>



<ul><li>Push for a “post-Chicago School” approach to antitrust, appointing enforces who appreciate the need to encourage competition, nominating judges who are committed to the original aims of the antitrust laws, and supporting legislation and administrative actions that encourage competition.</li><li>To support these goals, he would support legislation to restore the Clayton Antitrust Act to its original purpose of encouraging competition instead of solely focusing on general public welfare.</li></ul>



<p><strong><em>Codifying a right to repair</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Big corporations have been intentionally making their products more difficult to repair by adding software that prohibit non authorized repairmen from doing the work. These practices prevent owners of products and small businesses from doing the work and increase the costs for consumers because of the lack of competition.<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper would encourage Congress to pass legislation that prohibits companies from preventing others from repairing their high-value products by:</p>



<ul><li>Outlawing diagnostic authorization</li><li>Requiring companies to release repair-related manuals.</li></ul>



<p>This proposal would be directed towards large purchase like automobiles and agricultural equipment. This change would lead to more market competition amongst repairmen because smaller shops could fix a greater variety of products.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Limiting non-compete agreements and prohibiting non-poach agreements in franchises</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Too many American workers have lost the ability to break out on their own because of non- compete and non-poach agreements. Companies should not be able to tell their employees they can’t look for better opportunities elsewhere. These agreements stifle innovation, suppress wage growth, and prevent workers from taking the skills they have learned to new adventures. States that do not enforce these agreements see more innovation, more startups, and higher wages for employees.<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper would urge Congress to:</p>



<ul><li>Pass limits on non-compete agreements in hiring contracts to short durations</li><li>Prohibit non-competes for non-exempt employees</li><li>Force companies to prove genuine harm before legally enforcing the agreements</li></ul>



<p>Hickenlooper would also enforce our antitrust laws appropriately to prevent franchises from using “no poach” laws to prevent workers from benefiting from competition.</p>



<p><strong><em>Federal data collection and publishing</em></strong><br></p>



<p>The federal government’s commitment to addressing and understanding industry consolidation needs to be redoubled. In 1981, the Federal Trade Commission stopped publishing and collecting industry concentration data. [9]<br></p>



<p>As President, Hickenlooper would bring back the required 1981 Federal Trade Commission reporting on industry concentration. Moreover, he would also commission more studies and analyses, including retrospective evaluations of consummated mergers, providing guidance for future work and even investigating whether completed mergers should be undone.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Fueling growth for micro-businesses with a new $50 billion tax credit</em></strong><br></p>



<p>This “Mom &amp; Pop” tax credit allows owners who are actively engaged in managing their microbusiness (businesses with 5 or fewer full-time employees and with revenues of less than $10 million annually) to receive up to $50,000 in lifetime tax credits based on two years of demonstrated growth of the business. [10] The applicant may earn a credit equal to 20% of the payments in new investments or new employment at the microbusiness. The total lifetime tax credits claimed by any single applicant and any related persons are limited to $50,000.<br></p>



<p>The Small Business Administration would be authorized to award tax credits up to $5 billion each calendar year, plus any unclaimed credits carried forward from the prior year. This would result in 1 million micro-entrepreneurs being eligible for a $50,000 tax credit.<br></p>



<p><strong><em>Fueling rural and distressed-area growth — $10 billion investment in “Entrepreneurial Opportunity Zones”</em></strong><br></p>



<p>Based on the Colorado Rural Jump-Start program, Hickenlooper also proposes a new national program of Entrepreneurial Opportunity Zones, which will provide incentives for entrepreneurs and workers in rural and distressed areas by providing tax relief to new businesses and new hires of these businesses. Companies participating in the Jump-Start program must:</p>
