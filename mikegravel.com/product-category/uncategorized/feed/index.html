								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As author of Citizen Power in 1971, Senator Mike Gravel determined that much of what he wrote then is apropos in America today; hence, the release of Citizen Power: A Mandate for Change that reflects the accuracy of his evaluation of problems then, his current position on a number of issues facing America now, and the process that Americans can undertake to become empowered as lawmakers in partnership with their elected officials. Most chapters of Citizen Power: A Mandate for Change present material from the original book, as well as new information and revised positions. The exceptions are Chapter 2: The National Initiative, and Chapter 7: The War on Drugs. All other chapters cover similar topics in both books, but with the senator&#8217;s fresh insights for today&#8217;s world. Each chapter ends with how the National Initiative, once enacted, could help solve the problems presented in that chapter. The Table of Contents is as follows: Chapter 1 &#8211; Now It&#8217;s the Citizen&#8217;s TurnChapter 2 &#8211; The National InitiativeChapter 3 &#8211; America&#8217;s Failure in EducationChapter 4 &#8211; Tax Reform &#8211; The Fair TaxChapter 5 &#8211; The Health Security SystemChapter 6 &#8211; National Environmental &amp; Energy PolicyChapter 7 &#8211; The War on DrugsChapter 8 &#8211; Crime &amp; PunishmentChapter 9 &#8211; The Shroud of SecrecyChapter 10 &#8211; American ImperialismChapter 11 &#8211; Global GovernanceChapter 12 &#8211; Who Stole the American Dream?</p>
