<p>It is hard to give up something you claim you never had. That is the 
difficulty Americans face with respect to their country’s empire. Since 
the era of Theodore Roosevelt, politicians, journalists, and even some 
historians have deployed euphemisms—“expansionism,” “the large policy,” 
“internationalism,” “global leadership”—to disguise America’s imperial 
ambitions. According to the exceptionalist creed embraced by both 
political parties and most of the press, imperialism was a European 
venture that involved seizing territories, extracting their resources, 
and dominating their (invariably dark-skinned) populations. Americans, 
we have been told, do things differently: they bestow self-determination
 on backward peoples who yearn for it. The refusal to acknowledge that 
Americans have pursued their own version of empire—with the same 
self-deceiving hubris as Europeans—makes it hard to see that the US 
empire might (like the others) have a limited lifespan. All empires 
eventually end, but maybe an exceptional force for global good could 
last forever—or so its champions seem to believe.</p>



<p>The refusal to 
contemplate the scaling back of empire shuts down what ought to be our 
most urgent foreign policy debate before it has even begun. That is why 
these two new books are so necessary, and so welcome: they are the most 
serious efforts since Chalmers Johnson’s <em>Blowback</em> series (2004–2010) to reopen the question of American empire by taking for granted that it exists. Victor Bulmer-Thomas’s<em> Empire in Retreat</em>
 maintains that America has harbored imperial ambitions since its 
founding, and argues that its focus shifted in the twentieth century, 
from acquiring territory to penetrating foreign countries and 
influencing their governments to support US strategic and economic 
interests. David Hendrickson’s <em>Republic in Peril</em> sees that shift as the result of a decisive embrace of interventionism, aimed at extending US power throughout the world.</p>



<p>Both
 authors think withdrawal from overextended military commitments could 
strengthen America. Bulmer-Thomas, a British diplomat and scholar, 
recommends it as a pragmatic adjustment to shrinking support for US 
empire at home and abroad. Hendrickson, a political scientist at 
Colorado College, provides a theoretical rationale for it, exploring the
 possibility of what he calls a new internationalism, based on respect 
for the sovereignty of other nations. Yet even as they catalog the many 
signs of imperial decline (economic, political, cultural), neither is 
sanguine that American policymakers can manage a graceful retreat.</p>



<p>Bulmer-Thomas
 begins by recounting the rise of the US territorial empire. He shows 
that America’s relationship with the land it acquired during westward 
expansion resembled the relationship between European countries and 
their colonies abroad. The United States, like European colonial powers,
 subjugated (and nearly exterminated) aboriginal populations; used 
military occupation as a buffer between white settlers and rebellious 
natives; and established only limited representative governments in 
their occupied territories. One resident of America’s territories 
complained that they were treated like “mere colonies, occupying much 
the same relation to the General Government as the colonies did to the 
British government prior to the Revolution.”</p>



<p>Most textbooks date 
the beginning of America’s overseas expansion to 1898, when it acquired 
sovereignty over Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines after the 
conclusion of its war with Spain. Yet as Bulmer-Thomas shows, the US 
empire went offshore much earlier. During the 1810s and 1820s, Americans
 carved out the state of Liberia in West Africa, allegedly as a refuge 
for free American blacks; the country in fact functioned as an American 
colony and later as a protectorate of the Firestone Rubber Company. The 
US established an imperial presence in East Asia as early as 1844, when 
the Treaty of Wanghia gave it the same privileged access to Chinese 
ports as the British Empire, and went on to acquire dozens of “guano 
islands” in the Pacific, where abundant bird droppings provided a rich 
source of fertilizer.</p>



<p>During the 1890s, the 
American zeal for distant acquisitions slipped into high gear, as 
politicians realized they were arriving late to the imperial game. Led 
by Theodore Roosevelt and other advocates of expansion, they sought land
 through annexation and collaboration with American business interests 
(Hawaii) as well as through war with Spain. These acquisitions began as 
additions to the territorial empire but gradually acquired a more 
ambiguous character. They came to form the foundation of what 
Bulmer-Thomas calls America’s “semi-global empire,” built not on 
territorial acquisition but on the maintenance of client states and 
various other forms of international interference, including military 
bases that supported occasional armed interventions in local conflicts 
and multinational corporations run mostly by Americans.</p>



<p>The 
Philippines offers a case in point of America’s nonterritorial form of 
empire. The US declared war on Spain in 1898 with the avowed intention 
of ending Spanish rule in Cuba, but even before the declaration 
President William McKinley had dispatched the US Asiatic Squadron under 
Commodore George Dewey to Hong Kong in preparation for an assault on the
 Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. As soon as war was declared, Dewey moved 
quickly and crushed the Spanish forces. Their surrender emboldened the 
Filipino rebels, who erroneously assumed that the US had arrived to 
liberate them from their Spanish oppressors. The US military quickly 
disabused them of that delusion by embarking on a ferocious 
counterinsurgency campaign, which lasted for years and included the 
systematic torture and slaughter of Filipinos. As many as 250,000 died, 
but the US imperialists never doubted the sanctity of their cause. 
“Nothing can be more preposterous than the proposition that these men 
were entitled to receive from us sovereignty over the entire country 
which we were invading,” Secretary of War Elihu Root said in 1900 about 
the Filipino rebels. “As well the friendly Indians, who have helped us 
in our Indian wars, might have claimed the sovereignty of the West.”</p>



<p>Statehood
 was never considered during the debate over the Philippines: the only 
question was whether to establish a naval base at Manila and give the 
islands back to the Spanish or to annex the entire archipelago. The 
imperialists won the argument, and after the insurgents were finally 
suppressed the Philippines became a colony, from which investors in 
sugar, hemp, tobacco, and coconut oil could gain privileged access to US
 markets and Filipinos could emigrate to America in search of jobs. By 
the 1930s, congressional opposition to cheap exports as well as to cheap
 (and nonwhite) labor created support for Philippine independence, which
 was finally achieved in 1946. But it came with so many restrictions on 
trade and so much preferential treatment for American investors—not to 
mention continued maintenance of US military bases—that “it would be 
more accurate to describe the Philippines as becoming a US 
protectorate,” Bulmer-Thomas writes. “Thus, the end of colonialism in 
the Philippines did not mean the end of US imperial control.”</p>



<p>A 
similar pattern of indirect imperial control also applied to Central 
America and the Caribbean. The US dominated that region during the 
twentieth century through colonies (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
 Panama Canal Zone), but more broadly by using its economic influence to
 interfere in domestic politics and maintain governments that would 
faithfully serve American interests (as was the case in Cuba until 
1959), or by establishing asymmetrical bilateral treaties and customs 
receiverships—the collection of customs duties by US officials, who then
 used the money to pay off the debt service owed on American loans. This
 arrangement survived in the Dominican Republic until 1942 and in Haiti 
until 1947.</p>



<p>Military interventions underwrote economic domination.
 Sometimes this involved sending in the US Marines and leaving them in 
place for decades, as in Haiti from 1915 to 1934. Sometimes it required 
using military force to crush a rebellion and arranging for the 
emergence of a cooperative dictator, such as Rafael Trujillo in the 
Dominican Republic, whose brutalities the Americans tolerated as long as
 he respected US strategic interests in the region. This he did for 
thirty years, until his attempt in 1960 to overthrow the Venezuelan 
government cost him US support. Sensing an opportunity, his opponents 
assassinated him. But the US was still committed to maintaining the 
imperial relationship, and President Lyndon Johnson sent in the Marines 
in 1965 to prevent the left-of-center president Juan Bosch (who had been
 ousted by a military coup) from returning to power.</p>



<p>Johnson’s
 intervention recalled the conflicts of the early twentieth century, but
 during World War II and the cold war, US imperial strategies had begun 
to shift. As the USSR consolidated its power, the US scaled back its 
pursuit of territory abroad. Instead, it extended its imperial reach 
through the development of international institutions that would serve 
its interests but could not also be used against it. At Bretton Woods in
 1944, the US initiated the creation of the <abbr>IMF</abbr> and the 
World Bank. Both institutions are headquartered in Washington, and the 
president of the World Bank has always been an American, by custom if 
not fiat.</p>



<p>The Point Four Program, drawn from Harry Truman’s 
inaugural address in 1949, linked the World Bank to the struggle with 
the Soviet Union for influence in the developing world, where the bank 
would make loans, with many political conditions attached, to 
governments and state-owned enterprises (later privately owned ones as 
well). The requirement that Congress approve these loans ensured that 
they would reflect what the US government considered its national 
interest. The United Nations, too, began as an American-dominated 
institution, though as its membership grew it became progressively 
harder for the US to control. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and bilateral treaties worldwide 
also served American policy under the guise of “collective security” 
against the Soviet threat.</p>



<p>All these arrangements were fortified 
by the principle articulated in the Truman Doctrine of 1947—that 
aggression must be stopped everywhere. Such a commitment “assumes that 
foreign conflicts feature evil aggressors and innocent victims,” as 
Hendrickson writes. This unexamined assumption was endorsed and promoted
 by leaders from both political parties, who helped sustain an 
atmosphere of perpetual moral crisis during the cold war. The US, 
working through the <abbr>CIA</abbr>, helped to overthrow elected 
left-leaning governments in Iran, Guatemala, Congo, Brazil, and Chile. 
Interventions anywhere could always be rationalized as 
counterinterventions against the allegedly omnipresent Soviet threat.</p>



<p>When
 the cold war ended, the US’s geopolitical rationale for military 
interventionism—the need to contain communism—swiftly disappeared, as 
the country found itself in the heady position of being the world’s sole
 superpower. This was what is now viewed, with some nostalgia, as the 
unipolar moment. And yet even in the absence of its longtime ideological
 rival, the United States continued to conduct foreign policy with the 
same moral fervor that had informed its actions in the cold war, and 
with the same confidence that it was a force for global good.</p>



<p>Under
 the presidency of Bill Clinton, much of official Washington began to 
believe “that US empire would best be served by the promotion of 
democracy abroad—or at least an American version of democracy—on the 
grounds that US security, free market economies and democracies are 
mutually reenforcing,” as Bulmer-Thomas writes. The rationale for 
democracy promotion, in the words of Clinton’s first National Security 
Strategy, was that “democratic states are less likely to threaten our 
interests and more likely to cooperate with the US to meet security 
threats and promote sustainable development.” This formulation could 
work in some circumstances, but not all. Other nations could have good 
reasons to see democracy promotion as a form of aggression, as Russia 
did when Clinton sought to expand <abbr>NATO</abbr> eastward despite the
 promises made by his predecessors in the first Bush administration and 
the warnings of many seasoned diplomats, led by George Kennan.</p>



<p>Establishing
 “US hegemony across the globe,” in Bulmer-Thomas’s words, was not only 
about promoting democracy abroad but also about maintaining military 
supremacy everywhere. In 2000, despite cuts in personnel and the closure
 of many US bases, the Defense Department committed itself to the 
pursuit of “full spectrum dominance.” This goal, outlined in <em>Joint Vision 2020</em>,
 the Department of Defense’s blueprint for the future, meant the 
worldwide control of land, sea, air, and space, including cyberspace.</p>



<p>The
 triumphalist mood following the end of the cold war also emboldened 
neoconservative ideologues. Two of them, William Kristol and Robert 
Kagan, founded the Project for the New American Century in 1997. Its 
“Statement of Principles” pledged to “rally support for American global 
leadership” through “a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral 
clarity.” This was nothing if not an exceptionalist, even unilateralist 
creed, based on faith in the uniqueness of America’s position as a 
global leader. It evoked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s claim 
that the US was “the indispensable nation.”</p>



<p>The 
neoconservatives found their president in George W. Bush. Even before 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Bush began to implement 
neoconservative policies, withdrawing from international organizations 
and agreements—including (in June 2002) the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty with Russia. This decision, according to Ivo Daalder of the 
Brookings Institution and other critics at the time, signaled a swerve 
in US nuclear strategy from deterrence to “war-fighting.”</p>



<p>The 
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon provided a new 
enemy, international terrorism, that was even more shadowy and elusive 
than international communism had been. Widespread panic among Americans 
and their allies was taken (especially in the US) to justify a permanent
 state of emergency, with damaging consequences for civil liberties and 
public debate at home, as well as for the many thousands of civilians 
who would become “collateral damage” in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p>After
 September 11, new rationales for military intervention abroad 
emerged—not only preventative war against terror (the false 
justification for invading Iraq) but also <abbr>R2P</abbr> (the Responsibility to Protect). As Hendrickson shows, <abbr>R2P</abbr>
 originated in the recommendation of a Canadian government commission 
and received a modified but contested acceptance by the UN in 2005. <abbr>R2P</abbr>
 provides a virtually blank check for using force on humanitarian 
grounds—an idea that has little support from non-Western nations. In 
practice it vitiates a central assumption of international law—that each
 state has the right to defend itself. In his second inaugural address, 
Bush spelled out the vision of universal empire behind <abbr>R2P</abbr>: “The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.” This was the Truman Doctrine on steroids.</p>



<p>Hendrickson
 thinks American disregard for international law helps explain the 
incoherence of contemporary strategic thought. According to 
exceptionalist ideology, the US is the primary guardian of international
 law, on which global stability depends. Yet Hendrickson (like 
Bulmer-Thomas) makes clear that more often than not, the putative 
rule-maker has in fact broken rules and acted in ways that it would not 
tolerate from any other nation.</p>



<p>The American exceptionalist double
 standard is especially apparent in its current military operations 
overseas. Consider the battle-ready presence of the US Navy in the South
 China Sea. Imagine a rival power behaving as aggressively in the 
Caribbean, lecturing us on our misdeeds (as we have lectured the 
Chinese) and appointing itself a neutral umpire for the region. A 
retired Chinese admiral, quoted by Hendrickson, puts the matter 
succinctly: the US Navy in East Asia is like “a man with a criminal 
record ‘wandering just outside the gates of a family home.’”</p>



<p>Or take the confrontation emerging on the western border of Russia. The missile defense system installed by <abbr>NATO</abbr> on Russia’s doorstep, combined with <abbr>NATO</abbr>
 troops conducting military exercises, could not be more provocative. No
 great power, least of all the United States, would allow deployments so
 close to its borders without protest and (probably) retaliation.</p>



<p>While
 Bulmer-Thomas treats imperial expansion as a continuous feature of 
American history that has run afoul of historical circumstance, 
Hendrickson reconstructs an anti-imperial tradition in Anglophone 
thought, which he calls “liberal pluralism” and recommends reviving in 
view of our crumbling American empire. In his view, liberal pluralism 
was embodied in the system of European nation-states (the “Westphalian 
system”) that emerged from the Thirty Years’ War. It was also the 
worldview of America’s founders, uniting Washington, Jefferson, 
Hamilton, and Madison in their suspicion of military adventures abroad. 
From the liberal pluralist perspective, war is the <em>summum malum</em> 
of international affairs; respect for the sovereignty of other nations 
is the best way to avoid it. Sovereignty is the core of international 
law: every state has the right to defend itself from external attack; 
none has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another.</p>



<p>The  fact that liberal pluralism discourages interference does not, however,  imply that it encourages nations to be passive bystanders in the face  of immoral foreign policies, as contemporary political theorists who  favor an interventionist approach like to claim. Liberal pluralism “does  not,” Hendrickson insists, “dictate indifference to human rights”; it  allows states to shelter dissidents and welcome refugees from  oppression. “What it does not allow is coercive intervention in a  foreign country to secure those rights.”</p>

<p>Hendrickson concentrates his criticisms on the reckless use of 
military force in foreign lands; he does not dismiss economic sanctions 
as an alternative. Nor does he rule out interference in extreme 
situations, such as the threat of genocide. But he insists that such 
interventions be—as far as possible—multilateral, peaceful, and 
respectful of international law. He proposes maintaining <abbr>NATO</abbr>,
 but with our nuclear guarantees to its members on a strictly 
“no-first-use” basis; preserving friendships with allies but also 
working out “rules of the road with putative adversaries.” He argues 
that fighting terrorism requires effective policing at home and the 
support of functioning governments abroad, not their overthrow. The 
liberal pluralist tradition, in his view, provides intellectual 
resources for reducing international tension and redirecting national 
wealth toward urgently necessary aims—rebuilding infrastructure, 
reviving the welfare state, and addressing the menace of climate change 
and oceanic catastrophe.</p>



<p>In recent years, popular 
support for imperial adventures has waned. Large majorities have opposed
 sending US troops to Libya, Syria, and Ukraine. The percentage of 
Americans who think it is “very important” that the US should “maintain 
superior military power worldwide” dropped from 68 percent in 2002 to 52
 percent in 2014. And poll respondents ranked military supremacy sixth 
out of ten among foreign policy aims. The top-ranked goal was 
“protecting the jobs of American workers.”</p>



<p>The shift in public 
opinion is a response to a series of failed interventions: efforts at 
regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria have left behind chaos, failed 
states, terrorist recruits, and endless war. But whatever disagreements 
they may have had over policy details, all three presidents since 
September 11 have shared a commitment to US global military supremacy. 
No major policymaker wants to admit publicly what many suspect 
privately: that America’s imperial reach has begun to exceed its grasp. 
Barring a dramatic shift in public discourse, the American empire will 
not go gentle into that good night; more likely it will, as Dylan Thomas
 counseled the old, “burn and rave at close of day.”</p>



<p>No one burns 
and raves more flagrantly than Donald Trump. The failure of blank-check 
interventions fed the discontent he exploited in the 2016 campaign. Yet 
his chauvinist posturing has turned out to be little more than a 
belligerent, unhinged version of the militarized globalism he claimed to
 displace. So Trump lurches from one outrageous provocation to another 
while most of his critics repeat the stale formulas of global 
leadership. Neither side seems to notice that the rest of the world does
 not want to be led (though some countries may still want their security
 to be guaranteed by US power). More and more foreign countries are 
trying to go about their business on their own, even in areas once 
assumed to be vital to the US national interest—Latin America, the 
Middle East, the South China Sea, even the Korean peninsula, where the 
South Koreans have done what American leaders were unable or unwilling 
to do: initiate diplomacy with North Korea.</p>



<p>Other pillars of 
American power are also crumbling, as Bulmer-Thomas demonstrates in 
detail. Multinational corporations are no longer as dependent on 
American policies abroad for access to foreign markets; General Motors, 
for example, now sells more cars in China than anywhere else on earth, 
without benefit of a US presence there. Recent years have seen a steady 
fall in the US net investment ratio (gross investment less the 
consumption of fixed capital), both private and public. The consequence 
has been a decline in infrastructure (including public education), as 
well as a slowing of innovation and productivity. At the same time, 
neoliberal politicians in both parties, committed to cutting back the 
“entitlements” provided by the welfare state and privatizing the public 
sector, have underwritten the rise of inequality and social immobility. 
The effect has been to undermine the broad prosperity that was the 
domestic basis of the semi-global empire.</p>



<p>International institutions, rather than reinforcing American hegemony, challenge it. The UN, the <abbr>IMF</abbr>,
 and the World Bank have all proven unreliable in promoting US 
interests. At the UN, the US is more isolated than ever on the Security 
Council, as the dramatic increase in American vetoes shows. Various 
countries have learned to avoid borrowing from the <abbr>IMF</abbr>, 
with the onerous conditions it imposes, by building up their foreign 
exchange reserves and paying off existing debts. The World Bank now has 
two significant rivals, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the
 New Development Bank (which represents the <abbr>BRICS</abbr> 
countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The 
Organization of American States has been superseded, since 2011, by the 
Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, which insisted on the 
inclusion of Cuba despite US opposition. China is creating its own 
version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without US participation, as 
well as expanding into sub-Saharan Africa and cutting a deal with 
Nicaragua for another isthmian canal.</p>



<p>Yet Trump and his opponents 
in the Washington consensus still envision a unipolar world, where the 
United States can ignore the legitimate claims of rival nations and do 
pretty much whatever it wants, whether because of its sheer greatness 
(Trump) or its exceptional goodness (Clinton et al.). Obama was cautious
 about intervening in Syria and eager to negotiate with Iran, but his 
administration maintained or intensified commitments to global military 
supremacy, blanket surveillance, targeted drone assassinations, and 
modernization of nuclear weapons, as well as engagement in the Middle 
East and East Asia. Fundamental policies persisted despite Obama’s 
misgivings.</p>



<p>Neither Bulmer-Thomas nor Hendrickson believes these  policies can continue without catastrophe. And it might, in any case,  not be in the US’s interests for them to continue. As Bulmer-Thomas  reminds us, “Imperial retreat is not the same as national decline, as  many other countries can attest. Indeed, imperial retreat can strengthen  the nation-state just as imperial expansion can weaken it.” Yet as  Hendrickson concludes, “It is crystal clear that the empire is fully  determined to stick around,” despite our desperate need to dismantle it.  The drift of global events may eventually require the United States to  acknowledge the reality of a multipolar world, but we cannot assume that  the process will be peaceful. Still, Hendrickson has performed an  urgently necessary service in reconstructing the liberal pluralist  tradition. He reminds us that there is a humane alternative to  contemporary orthodoxy, if we can only recognize it.</p>
