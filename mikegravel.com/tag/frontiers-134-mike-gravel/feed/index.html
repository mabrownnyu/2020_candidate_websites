<p><span class="s1">Steven Spielberg&#8217;s recently released film “The Post” has generated a lot of interest in the Pentagon Papers and Mike Gravel, who wasn’t in the movie but played a role in making the top-secret government documents public.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alaskans elected Gravel to the U.S. Senate in 1968, almost a half-century ago.  He now lives in California and will turn 88 in May.</span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although Gravel has fallen off Alaska’s political radar, he was a senator for 12 years during an important period for the new state.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For those of you who are new to Alaska, this is the guy who proposed building an indoor city near Denali as a federally funded winter tourism project.  Gravel was ridiculed after the media dubbed it a “Dome City.”</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alaska politics may be a lot of things, but it’s never dull – which makes the 50-year milestone seems like a good time for Frontiers to look back at this quirky and charismatic politician, whose love of big ideas once captured the imagination of Alaskans.  </span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some of the highlights from this week’s show.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<ul class="ul1">
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Campaign Upset: Travel back to 1968 and take a look at Mike Gravel’s campaign film, &#8220;Man for Alaska,&#8221; produced by some of the best in the business. How it helped a tall, dark and handsome candidate beat a sitting senator in the Democratic primary.</span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">The Crazy Genius of Mike Gravel: From his battle to publicize the Pentagon Papers to his run for U.S. President, a look at the curious career of Mike Gravel. </span></li>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Political Analysis:  Two veteran Alaska journalists, Michael Carey and Tim Bradner, share their memories of Mike Gravel and look at what made him so controversial.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We also had a lot of help from Art Hackney and Francine Taylor, who each have a different take on Gravel. Hackney is a political consultant and Taylor worked on Gravel’s 1968 campaign.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Hackney says Gravel was more of a showman than a public servant. Taylor believes Gravel was a man of courage and fought the good fight, but both agree his character flaws may have contributed to the ups and downs of his political career.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">As for Gravel, he says he has no regrets. I sat down with him two years ago, when he visited Anchorage to give a seminar. He says he believes his role as a politician was to “stir the pot,” which is definitely something he succeeded at.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="Article-paragraph">
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This week’s show features highlights from that interview, along with footage that truly is as entertaining as it is informative.</span></p>
