								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Modernity’s major advancements in human governance are: representative governments and the nation-states they govern, which we call democracies. But “democracy” is a misnomer, since the polity is ruled by elites through representatives who corrupt political campaigns and manipulate the voting process while maintaining the fiction that the people rule because they are able to vote for politicians to represent their interests. The solution to this dysfunctional polity is to bring the people into the operations of government as lawmakers in a governing partnership with their elected representatives. Lawmaking is the central power of government, the only governing power in which all the people could participate. Initially, in an electoral process that circumvents national governments, the people need to enact specific legislation, the National Citizens Initiative for Democracy that provides the nation’s citizens with legislative procedures to deliberatively exercise their sovereign legislative powers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Freedom is participation in power.”</strong><br />
<strong>Marcus Cicero </strong><br />
<strong>(BCE Senator of Rome)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Lawmaking is the central power of government, superior to the execution of laws by the executive or the adjudication of laws by the judiciary. Voting in elections is also inferior to the making of laws, since whoever makes the law determines who votes, when, where and how voting takes place. Representatives in government monopolize the making of laws and are thereby able to protect the property and wealth of elites, who fund their elections and thereby control governments.It is of little consequence whether the structure of representative government is based on a parliamentary system as in Great Britain, or on a written constitutional system as in the United States.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There are only two possible venues for change: the people or the government. It is in the latter, wherein exists the structural problem of governance. Efforts at improving the structure of representative government by bringing the people into its legislative operations are unfortunately dependent on the legislative actions of representatives who are averse to diluting their power under the present structure. We are left with the fiction that electing the right people to public office will bring about fundamental structural change. So we repeat over and over again something that has been proven repeatedly not to work.Nevertheless, this logic does not diminish the need to elect people of integrity to public office. The point is that the election of representatives is not enough to overcome the control of representative government by society’s elites.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">All people dream of freedom and happiness, particularly those who have experienced the inequities and repressions of autocratic governments. The focus herein is on the American experience, whose narrative is most familiar to this author; however, the solution I suggest for human governance is applicable to peoples of all nations. Americans were blessed with physical geography and the intellectual inheritance of the Scottish, English, and French Ages of Enlightenment, when ancient Greek and Roman concepts of governance experienced a rebirth. It wasnot until 1787 that its structure of government took permanent shape, the design of which produced a constitutional republic — a representative government — sourcing much of its laws from British parliamentary practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">When the Constitutional Framers met in convention in Philadelphia in 1787, their motivation in designing a new government was influenced by the fact that the 13 confederate states were falling apart because they were acting as independent sovereigns. The convention delegates were the wealthy elites of that period, who realized that any loss of civic cohesion would directly affect the value of their personal property.The design of their new government did not include the structure of direct democracy that was so successfully employed in the New England town meetings and so profusely lauded by the founders as the people’s right to change and alter governments.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Unfortunately, the pall of slavery gripped the convention’s proceedings, holding hostage the possibility of a truly democratic process. Exaggerating this tragedy was the fact that probably the best opportunity to rid the nation of the scourge of slavery was in the period from the cessation of Revolutionary War hostilities in 1781 to the beginning of the Philadelphia Convention in May 1787. Free blacks and slaves had fought in the Revolutionary War,earning their share of the American dream. Eli Whitney had yet to invent his cotton gin, which later created a southern economy dependent on slave-produced cotton.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The American dream of freedom was eclipsed when the delegates to the convention failed to keep faith with the principles of the Declaration of Independence, articulated 11 years earlier, that “all men are created equal.”The delegates from South Carolina and Georgia blackmailed James Madison, the architect of the convention, and the rest of the delegates into accepting slavery as the price for their states joining the new government.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The legacy of slavery plagues us to this day. Repeated generational transfers of cruel, inhumane norms of conduct toward fellow humans, rationalized by Holy Scripture, have damaged the American psyche, perhaps beyond repair. We are a violent people, sustained by religious fervor and a dysfunctional government.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The American psyche was further coarsened by the national sense of “manifest destiny,” the idea that God wished us to exercise dominion over the land. Land represented economic freedom and a chance for upward mobility. The land of the continent was there for the taking, even though Native Americans already occupied the land. In a cruel electoral calculus, settlers used their government’s military power to legalize their continued encroachments on Indian lands. Settlers voted, but Indians did not. The Indians were not formally enslaved, but worse, national policy dictated their annihilation.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Constitutional Framers, the elites of their day, created a system of representative government that held a monopoly on legislative power, facilitating policies that shame us to this day. Regardless of how much we praise the American form of government, it cannot by any stretch of the imagination be called egalitarian or democratic, particularly with the present growing breach of economic inequality. Our Constitution, creating a structure of representative government, favors elites simply because it was written by elites who provided for the continuity of their power by establishing procedures whereby they alone could amend the Constitution with Article V and make laws with Article I.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Framers had to exclude the people from the ratification process in order to secure their flawed Constitution. They had to avoid a ratifying vote in both the Confederate Congress and in the state legislatures, where there would have been strong opposition to maintaining slavery in perpetuity.The solution was to persuade both institutions to refer ratification to state conventions called for that specific purpose. The convention scenario permitted the elites to keep the people at arms length, denying them a legislative role in the ratification process of a constitution that not only enshrined slavery in perpetuity, but alsofailed to provide procedures for the people to make laws.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1778, almost ten years prior to the Constitutional Convention, Massachusetts had placed before its citizens a state constitution for ratification that included slavery. The people refused to ratify it. In 1780, a state constitution authored by John Adams that excluded slavery was overwhelmingly ratified. The Framers in Philadelphia were well aware of the Massachusetts experience and cut the people out of theratification process, the impact of which was to alter the nature of American governance to this day, excluding the direct participation of the people in the making of laws.<br />
The Founders believed that the people had every right to exercise their legislative sovereignty to make laws. They are quoted frequently, pointing out that future generations have an obligation to alter their governments and constitutions to suit their interests. America’s foremost founder,George Washington, in 1787 stated it best:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“People can decide with as much propriety on the alterations and amendments <div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box hundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"  style='background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;'><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row "><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1 fusion-builder-column-1 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last fusion-column-no-min-height 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;'>
					<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"   data-bg-url="">
						[to the Constitution] which shall be found necessary, as ourselves, for I do not conceive that we are more inspired, have more wisdom or possess more virtue than those who will come after us.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 1789 James Wilson, a Scottish scholar, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, the prime mover in securing the rapid ratification of the Constitution in Pennsylvania and an initial Associate Justice of the first Supreme Court, most strongly referred to the people’s legislative power saying:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>“All power is originally in the People and should be exercised by them in person, if it can be done with convenience, or even with little difficulty.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Nevertheless, the Framers sacrificed the people’s lawmaking power in order to protect the ratification of a Constitution compromised by slavery. The constitutional Framers failed to provide legislative procedures that rightly belonged in the Constitution’s Article VII, the creation article that would have permitted the people to amend the Constitution and make laws.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Framers’ fears that giving that power to the people would empower them to remove slavery from the Constitution were well founded. The first lobbying act of the first Congress was an assault on slavery by Pennsylvania Quakers led by Benjamin Franklin.Congress successfully thwarted that effort at repeal, and it was agreed that Congress would never again address the repeal of slavery. Slavery wasso effectively embedded in the Constitution that its removal, short of a civil war, was impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Of the five features locking slavery into the Constitution, only one — that of a slave being counted as three-fifths of a person for congressional representation in the House of Representatives — was removed by the Civil War. The other four highly undemocratic features of the Constitution have remained to work their mischief on us to this dayare: 1) the Electoral College (blocking direct election of the president), 2) Article V (standards for approval in Congress and by state legislatures in amending the Constitution), 3) the Senate (where geographic areas are represented, rather than proportional representation of human beings), and 4) state and local control of federal elections.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The amending process described in Article V is so undemocratic that any amendment to the Constitution must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures. In effect, this continues to empower the majority of 13 state legislative chambers &#8212; 200 senators from 13 state senates, less than .0001 percent of the U.S. population ––can thwart any possiblenational reform. Little wonder so few changes,since its ratification in 1788, have been made to update the Constitution to meet the needs of the 21st century. Other than practical housekeeping revisions, the only substantial change to the Constitution was the expansion of the voting franchise. Property requirements (property ownership originally being necessary to vote) were essentially removed at the state level prior to the Civil War. Black males were enfranchised by Civil War amendments. The way was paved for a federal amendment to include women in 1920 by the repeated passage of initiative and referendum laws by state governments granting women the right to vote.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In my view, the most damaging legacy of the Constitution, other than the exclusion of the legitimate exercise of the people’s legislative powers, is the control of federal elections by state and local governments. By controlling who gets elected to federal office — presidents and members of Congress — states assert power superior to the federal power based in the Constitution. This issue is better understood as “states’ rights.” It keeps in contention the supremacy of the federal government.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Our Constitution has been extensively copied around the world, as has the British parliamentary system. Obviously, these structures of representative government easily satisfy the interests of elites in controlling societies.Representative government is the norm in all democracies,including Switzerland, which copied our Constitution in 1848but added one very significant change –– the people. The Swiss Constitution represents the next step in the evolution of national governance, adding the people as lawmakers, thus creating a successful governing partnership between the people and their elected officials. Nevertheless, the Swiss model would have better served the people’s interests had the legislative power of the people been totally independent of the power of its elected representatives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The first fundamental change in the structure of American governance took place at the end of the 19th century without ever amending the U.S. Constitution. Starting in 1898 and up until the First World War, more than 15 states copied the Swiss model,enacting laws permitting their citizens to initiate and enact laws. Citizens of only 12 states legislate with any frequency today. Like the Swiss model, citizen lawmaking is not independent of representatives in government, and as a result representatives and the judiciary use their power in attempts to continually diminish the people’s legislative role.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The motivation for the Initiative, Referendum and Recall (IRR) laws enacted at the turn of the 20th century was the abusive corruption of government by the business community in the post-Civil War era. A survey of the more than 1,500 initiatives enacted into law by citizen legislators over the last 100 years shows the people legislated on the same subjects as their elected legislators, except the people were considerably more responsible on fiscal matters.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The problem with representative government, irrespective of citizen participation as lawmakers, is the fact that it has never been easy to participate in the electoral process except under the direction and control of political parties.The Constitution makes no reference to political parties because the Framers universally disdained them as odious “factions.&#8221; Nevertheless, political parties appeared in the first presidential administration of George Washington and to this day carry more clout than most government powers defined by the Constitution. Historically, parties evolved around regional economic interests into a two-party monopoly, which they jealously guard with the full force of the law. It is to this unsanctioned power that special interests gravitate, seeking to influence the direction of public policy in venues hidden from public view.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Constitution distributes congressional representation geographically, where the economic interests of each state come into competitive confrontation for the limited wealth of the entire polity. Add to this a committee system in Congress designed to compartmentalize the specialization and expertise of individual members, who are ruled over by committee chairmen and ranking members (those with seniority) who acquire control of legislative empires, regardless of competence.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Because of these vested interests,representative government is incapable of structural change. As stated above, there are only two venues for change: the government, where the problems exist, and the people, whose beneficial interest is the purpose of government. The solution is obvious: people must be brought into the governing process in the only practicable role — that of lawmakers. The people may or may not be superior in intellect to the elites; however, the people acting as a constituency of the entire polity legislating by majority rule enjoys the benefits of the “wisdom of crowds.”The people do not have barriers in making decisions involving the public interest. The constituent majority identifies and votes its enlightened self-interest. The people are the public interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The structural flaw in representative government is the self-interest of representatives. In making decisions on public policy, the personal self-interest of representatives is naturally uppermost in their minds. Second, representatives must be sensitive to the financial interests of contributors who help them secure and maintain their office. Third is the interest of political parties in securing and retaining power, in which representatives share. It should be apparent that at this point the public interest is at the fourth level of decision-making. Religious and ideological beliefs and outright corruption may crowd out the public interest further.A system of governance that depends on private money to secure the public interest is generically flawed and naturally serves the interests of the wealthy elites controlling society.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Will laws enacted by citizens be perfect? Unlikely. But they will be greatly improved over the minority rule we now endure. When people make mistakes, they will be more inclined to make corrections. That is not the case with representatives, who are averse to admitting error for fear of having that information used against them in the next election.<br />
Representative government encourages immaturity in people. Demands for services are often accompanied by resistance to paying taxes for those services. Representative government is literally designed to keep the electorate in civic adolescence. Successful democratic governance requires that constituents act rationally and maturely. That can be done only if people are informed and take responsibility for the public policies they enact, rather than using the excuse of blaming their representatives. Direct democracy — people acting as lawmakers — is the only form of governance that permits people to be aware and take responsibility for their political actions. The key element to its success is citizens taking responsibility, which is also the key element to raising our children to mature adulthood.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The United States is not a democracy, nor are the other so-called “democracies” of the world. They are all representative governments. By definition,a democracy or a republicis a polity ruled by people. In our “democracies,” we elect representatives to rule the polity on our behalf and grant them a monopoly in making laws. Those we elect do not, for the most part, run the country first and foremost for the interest of the people. As human nature and the quest for power dictate, politicians function according to their own self-interests.The people are led to believe by those who control the polity that their power is in voting and that they have no choice but to give their sovereign legislative power to politicians on Election Day.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That need not be the case. A process of direct democracy can be designed to bring the people into the operations of government as lawmakers working in partnership with representatives in government, securing the best of both worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Since lawmaking is the central power of government, citizens can gain control of their government by becoming lawmakers, empowered to make laws for their own benefit. In jurisdictions where people are empowered to make laws, we find that people are more fiscally conservative than their elected officials, regardless of political party.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Elites question the competence of the people to make laws governing their lives. However, the people are expected to have sufficient competence to judge what politicians will do with the power conferred upon them in elections that are rigged by money from special interests and the propensity of politicians to say whatever it takes to get elected.This myth that the people are not up to the legislative task of their own self-governance is totally discredited by the 100-year history of the people competently legislating by initiative at the state and local levels of American government, by the Swiss national experience, and bythe experiences of several South American constituencies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">How can Americans and citizens of other countries become lawmakers when there is no provision in their constitutions or in national laws permitting them to do so? The Congress, or any national legislative body, is not likely to dilute its powers by empowering its people. Therefore, it is incumbent upon citizens to directly enact legislation exercising their sovereign power –– power not handed down by elites who happen to control the polity, but the sovereign power of citizenship conferred at birth–– to create governments, amend their constitutions and set up procedures to deliberately enact laws.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A delegate at the American constitutional convention in 1787 asked James Madison, the convention’s architect, how could they alter the structure of the Confederate government when any change required the unanimous agreement of all 13 states.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An Act establishing legislative procedures and an administrative agency to administer the legislative procedures on behalf of the citizens of the United States so they can deliberately exercise their legislative powers; and adding to the Federal Code.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Be It Enacted By The Citizens Of The United States:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 1. TITLE</strong></p>
<p>This act shall be known and may be cited as the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2. PREAMBLE</strong></p>
<p>We, the People of the United States, inherently possess the sovereign authority and power to govern ourselves. We asserted this power in our Declaration of Independence and in the ratification of our Constitution. We, the People, choose to participate as lawmakers in all government jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>THEREFORE,</strong> We, the People, sanction the election conducted by the nonprofit corporation Philadelphia II and establish the number of votes necessary for the enactment of the National Citizens Initiative for Democracy at the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election, permitting us to exercise our legislative powers by initiative, concurrently with the legislative powers we delegate to our elected representatives in all government jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>AND THEREFORE,</strong> We, the People, enact this Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, establishing a “Legislature of the People” and providing for its legislative procedures and their administration by a Citizens Trust on our behalf.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3. LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES</strong></p>
<p>The Citizens Trust (hereinafter “Trust”) shall qualify initiatives chronologically, limiting one initiative per week for each government jurisdiction. The Trust shall take advantage of contemporary technology in implementing these procedures so as to facilitate as much as possible the citizens’ legislative role. The essential elements of the initiative process include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p><strong>A. Sponsors.</strong><br />
Only citizens of the United States who are natural persons registered to vote may introduce and sponsor an initiative. The Sponsors shall be identified on the initiative, on any petition, and on any qualifying poll. The Trust may grant special chronological consideration to initiatives introduced by the Presidentor by the board of directors of Philadelphia II.</p>
<p><strong>B. Form.</strong><br />
An initiative shall comprise a Title, a Summary, a Preamble that states the subject and purposes for the initiative, and the complete text of the initiative.</p>
<p><strong>C. Content.</strong><br />
An initiative shall pertain to matters of public policy relevant to the government jurisdiction to which it is applicable. The Sponsors shall determine the initial wording of the initiative. The Title and Summary shall be subject to approval by the Trust.</p>
<p><strong>D. Subject.</strong><br />
An initiative shall address only one subject but may include related or mutually dependent parts.</p>
<p><strong>E. Word Limit.</strong><br />
An initiative shall contain no more than five thousand words, exclusive of the Title, Preamble, Summary, references, definitions and language that quotes existing law.</p>
<p><strong>F. Qualification.</strong><br />
Following approval of the Title and Summary by the Trust, an initiative may qualify for election in the relevant government jurisdiction by any one of the following methods:</p>
<p><strong>1) Citizen Petition.</strong><br />
An initiative shall qualify for election if it is the subject of a petition signed manually or electronically by a number of registered voters, to be specified by the Trust, within the relevant government jurisdiction. The time period allotted to gather qualifying petition signatures shall be at least one year and not more than two years, beginning on the date the first signature is collected.</p>
<p><strong>2) Public Opinion Poll of Citizens.</strong><br />
An initiative shall qualify for election when the subject matter described in the title and summary is approved by a majority of respondents in a public opinion poll. To qualify by this method, the polling plan, including the number of respondents, the methodology and the entity that will conduct the poll, shall be approved in advance by the Trust.</p>
<p><strong>3) Legislative Resolution.</strong><br />
An initiative shall qualify for election if a resolution, the wording of which is identical to the initiative as submitted by its sponsor, is passed by a simple majority in the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>G. Communications.</strong><br />
Once an initiative is qualified, the title, summary, preamble, text and the identity of its sponsors shall be published on an Internet website and in various mediums of communication. Additional information: the Hearing Record; the Deliberative Committee report; the result of the Legislative Advisory Vote; statements prepared by the Sponsors, other proponents and opponents; and a balanced analysis prepared by the Trust of the pros and cons of the initiative, including its costs and benefits and societal, environmental, and economic implications, shall be added to the publication of this initiative as this information becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>H. Public Hearing.</strong><br />
After an initiative qualifies for election, the Trust shall appoint a Hearing Officer to conduct a public hearing. Representatives of the initiative’s Sponsors and representatives of the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction shall participate in the hearing in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Trust. Testimony on the initiative by proponents, opponents and experts shall be solicited, and their testimonies shall be published as the Hearing Record.</p>
<p><strong>I. Deliberative Committee.</strong><br />
After the public hearings the Trust shall convene a Deliberative Committee demographically representing the government jurisdiction to review each initiative. The Deliberative Committee shall be drawn at random from a pool of citizens previously developed and maintained by the Trust. Each member of the Deliberative Committee shall be fairly compensated for time spent and expenses incurred in performance of Committee duties. The Trust shall provide technical support and such additional resources as are necessary for the effective discharge of the Committee&#8217;s duties. The Deliberative Committee shall review the Hearing Record, secure expert advice, deliberate the merits of the initiative, and prepare a written report of its deliberations and recommendations. By two-thirds vote, the Deliberative Committee may alter the Title, Summary, Preamble or text of the initiative, provided that the changes are consistent with the stated purposes of the initiative.</p>
<p><strong>J. Legislative Advisory Vote.</strong><br />
Each initiative, together with its Hearing Record and report of the Deliberative Committee, shall be transmitted to the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction. The legislative body shall conduct a public vote of its members, recording the yeas and nays on the initiative, within 90 days after receipt thereof. The vote of the legislative body is non-binding, serving only as an advisory to the citizens.</p>
<p><strong>K. Promotional Communications.</strong><br />
Any communication, regardless of the medium through which conveyed, that promotes or opposes an initiative shall conspicuously identify the person(s) responsible for that communication, in a manner specified by the Trust.</p>
<p><strong>L. Campaign Financing.</strong><br />
Only United States citizens may contribute funds, services or property in support of or in opposition to an initiative. Contributions from corporations including, but not limited to, such incorporated entities as industry groups, labor unions, political parties, political action committees, organized religious bodies and associations are specifically prohibited. Such entities are also prohibited from coercing or inducing employees, clients, customers, members, or any other associated persons to support or oppose an initiative. Violation of these prohibitions is a felony punishable by not more than one year in prison, or a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars, or both, per instance, applied to each person found guilty of the violation.</p>
<p><strong>M. Financial Disclosure.</strong><br />
The Trust shall establish financial reporting requirements applicable to initiative sponsors, proponents and opponents. The Trust shall make all financial reports available to the public immediately upon its receipt thereof. Failure of sponsors, proponents or opponents to comply with these reporting requirements shall be a felony punishable by not more than one year in prison or a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars, or both, per instance, applied to each person found guilty of the violation.</p>
<p><strong>N. Election.</strong><br />
Upon completion of the Legislative Advisory Vote, or 90 days after the initiative has been delivered to the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction, whichever occurs first, the Trust shall publish a schedule for the election of the initiative and shall conduct an election in accordance with the published schedule. The Trust shall conduct all initiative elections employing the most effective and secure technology. The Trust shalladminister an election twenty-four hours a day for seven days. The Trust shall make voting on initiatives as convenient as possible for citizens.</p>
<p><strong>O. Enactment.</strong><br />
An initiative that creates or modifies a constitution or charter becomes law when it is approved by more than one-half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction in each of two successive elections. If the amendment is approved in the first election, a second ratification election shall occur no earlier than six months and no later than a year after the first election. An initiative that enacts, modifies or repeals a statute becomes the law when approved by more than half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction who participate in the election.</p>
<p><strong>P. Effective Date.</strong><br />
The effective date of an initiative, if not otherwise specified in the initiative, shall be forty-five days after certification of its enactment by the Trust.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Judicial Review.</strong><br />
No court shall have the power to enjoin any initiative election except on grounds of fraud. After a statutory initiative has been enacted into law, courts, when requested, may determine the constitutionality of the law.</p>
<p><strong>R. Withdrawal.</strong><br />
The Sponsors of an initiative may withdraw an initiative from further consideration and processing at any time prior to a deadline established by the Trust.</p>

The latter is a futile exercise since convention platforms have little or no effect on policy decisions in Congress.</span></p>
<p><b>Two</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Assuming Bernie is intent on the presidency (I hope he is) and cannot persuade a sufficient number of super delegates to flip and secure the Democratic nomination (a fair assumption), he should join Jill Stein of the Green Party, who has already reached out to Bernie. There is a real possibility that as the Green Party standard bearer, a Sanders/Stein Green Party ticket could very well win the presidency in view of Trumps self-destruct tendency and Clinton’s criminality. As an added benefit it would break up the two party monopoly. I sincerely hope Bernie pursues this option rather than getting his supporters all worked up over the Democratic platform. Fighting for planks on the national Democratic platform is a placebo –– comfort therapy. Members of Congress don’t read platforms, much less, follow them.  Remember: “ all politics is local” not national.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adding to the mix this fall is the candidacy of Gary Johnson, former two-term governor of New Mexico, on the Libertarian ticket with his vice presidential candidate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld.  If it weren’t for their radical agenda, a ticket of two Republicans with executive experience from two Democratic states might have some appeal to a disillusioned electorate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to the success of these third-party candidates is their inclusion in the Presidential debates. From the getgo the Sanders/Stein ticket would poll more than the 15% threshold for their inclusion. The debates would permit Sanders to be more hard-hitting rather repeat his failures in the primaries. Stein’s toughness and detailed knowledge of the issues would bring a breath of fresh air to the contest. Trump and Clinton will drown in their negatives.</span></p>
<p><b>Three</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Bernie could succumb to the pressures from party elites, President Obama (who has been supporting Hillary all along), and mainstream media to endorse Hillary and remain supportive of her candidacy through the general election. This might give Bernie hope that if, before Election Day, she is struck down by her criminal negligence over her emails and the Clinton foundation, that he would be the obvious choice to replace her, having been the runner-up in the primaries.  The only problem with this scenario is that the Obama/Clinton Democratic Party is adamantly opposed to Bernie and his agenda. Remember who really controls the Democratic Party –– the 1%. In the event of a Clinton departure from the race after the convention and before the November election date (a distinct possibility) back-room party leaders and Obama are discussing plans to push Joe Biden or John Kerry to replace Hillary not Sanders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Likely as not, the House will remain Republican and possibly the Senate, since conservative funders are pouring money into down-ballot candidates to insulate themselves from a Trump or Clinton presidential administration. If Hillary is elected president, her administration will spend its initial political capital fighting off impeachment. A couple of House Republicans committee staffs are already investigating both her emails and the Clinton Foundation money laundering activities, and will now be able to capitalize on the opening FBI Director James Comey has laid bare.<img class="wp-image-942 alignright" src="http://mikegravel.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-1024x683.jpg" alt="Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore" width="313" height="209" srcset="https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-50x33.jpg 50w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-200x133.jpg 200w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-300x200.jpg 300w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-333x222.jpg 333w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-400x267.jpg 400w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-600x400.jpg 600w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-768x512.jpg 768w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-800x533.jpg 800w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore-1200x800.jpg 1200w, https://mikegravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Bernie_Sanders_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg 3161w" sizes="(max-width: 313px) 100vw, 313px" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If Bernie succumbs to the pressure and votes for or worse endorses Hillary, he will be ruined politically with his young supporters and come off as just another political opportunist more interested in his Senate career. Regardless of his decision, a Clinton administration and the Democratic Party it controls will marginalize Bernie after the election. However, if Bernie decides to choose a more independent course by going Green he can easily make the case that he was cheated out of the nomination by the Democratic Clinton machine thereby voiding any statement he may have made about supporting the Democratic nominee</span></p>
<p><b>Four: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if Bernie goes Green and wins the Presidency he will need this option more than ever if he hopes to see any part of his agenda enacted into law. However, this option is complicated by the fact that Bernie and his immediate advisors don’t have a viable plan to enact his agenda into law –– other than suggesting that a protest movement of his supporters would force the Congress to enact his agenda. In light of the history of protest movements, no one really accepts the plausibility of that suggestion other than the politically naïve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some would point out the success of the civil rights movement and the fight for women’s suffrage. Yes, but it took 80 years to get to a civil war decision and another 100 years of Jim-Crowism, and we are still cursed with racism. Yes, women’s suffrage finally succeeded after more than 150 years, but only because more than 20 states gave women the right to vote as a result of state initiative and referendum elections. This forced President Wilson’s wife and the Congress to act in 1920. Unfortunately, even the women’s Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) movement failed to enact a constitutional amendment with a 52% demographic advantage.</span></p>

It was one of the largest popular ground swells in the nation’s history, generating more votes by state and local elected bodies and by the people directly than had ever been seen.  The House of Representatives passed the freeze resolution unanimously. When President Ronald Reagan ignored the resolution, the movement dissipated, ultimately creating a generation of cynics.  The freeze resolution was just an expression of the People’s will. It lacked the force of law, which is the generic flaw of most movements. For the People’s will to prevail, it must be enacted as law –– not mere protests or party platforms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recent movements like Move On and Howard Dean’s Democracy for America have dissipated themselves over time and act as little more than lobbying efforts for good causes that never seem to get enacted into law. The Occupy Wall Street Movement, after polite tolerance by government, was snuffed out like a candle by the government’s police power. Political, social and economic protest movements demonstrate one thing: not that democracy is broken, but that it doesn’t exist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernie Sanders has suggested a plethora of meaningful social, economic and political justice issues, energizing the righteous dreams of his youthful supporters for change. What he has not explained is how these issues would be enacted into law. It is not sufficient to say the People’s protest will make the Congress enact laws.  That is unrealistic in view of a conservative majority –– Republican and Democratic ––  in Congress “</span></p>
<p><b>The How</b> <b>Bernie’s agenda and that of his supporters will be enacted into law</b> <b>is the essence of the political revolution he calls for and our country needs!</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are only two venues to bring about real change –– the government and the People. The elite 1% who finance the politicians who run the government, not only controls the Congress, the Executive and the Judiciary, but also control these same institutions at the state and local levels of government. The 1% will never initiate or abide any change that dilutes their power.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other venue for change is the People. However, under our system of representative government, the only power the People have is the power to vote –– in essence giving their power away on Election Day. (Mark Twain said it best: if voting could change anything, they wouldn’t let us do it.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The dysfunction of representative government is due in no small part to the fact that the Congress has a monopoly on making the laws that govern the nation. The central power of government is lawmaking outlined in the first section of the Constitution. Lawmaking is superior to presidential and judicial power.  Fortunately, lawmaking is the only avenue through which the People can most easily participate in their own governance as citizen legislators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This same solution was successfully addressed by an earlier generation of American Progressives at the turn of the 20</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">th</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> century. They copied the direct democracy system of Switzerland, where the people participate in the power of government as lawmakers, using initiatives drafted by ordinary citizens and presented to the entire electorate for decision. (Freedom is participating in power as Marcus Cicero defined 2000 years ago.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the Swiss model has a major flaw that was copied by Americans: the initiative legislative process is integrated into the structure of representative government.  This permits representatives to continually sabotage the People’s initiative lawmaking process since they rightly view it as diluting their power. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even in the face of an inadequate initiative process, Americans have over 100 years of legislative experience at the state and local levels of government, where citizens in 23 states have been enacting laws by initiative. Obviously, the solution to the flaw imported from Switzerland would be to make the citizen lawmaking process independent of representative government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clearly, if American citizens are qualified and able to make laws at the state and local levels of government, they are equally qualified to make laws at the national level, where federal laws are superior and take precedence over state and local laws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A recent survey, conducted by the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, reported that a full 90 percent of voters lack confidence in the country’s political system. There has never been a better time to enact legislation empowering Americans citizens to initiate and enact laws at the federal level of government. The government will never do this. Therefore the people must do it by going around the government.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The authority for voters to go around the government to directly enact legislation nationally that empowers American citizens to henceforth enact laws by initiative rests on the immutable premise that </span><b>there is no authority superior to the People ––</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> neither the Constitution nor the government it created. Our Constitution begins with “We the People … do ordain …” According to our Founding Fathers, the People can make changes to the Constitution they deem necessary to their happiness.  In their own words: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “The basis of our political system is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government.” — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">George Washington, 1787</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The people were, in fact, the fountain of all power. … They could alter constitutions as they pleased.”— </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Madison, 1787</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Each generation has a right to choose for itself the form of government it believes is promotive of its happiness.”</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">–– Thomas Jefferson, 1812</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“All power is originally in the People and should be exercised by them in person, if that could be done with convenience, or even little difficulty. — </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">James Wilson 1789</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, the Constitutional Framers failed to provide procedures in the Constitution for the People to amend the Constitution as they did for elected representatives in Article V.  The Framers established slavery in perpetuity in the Constitution, and they rightly feared the people would remove slavery if the People were provided procedures to amend the Constitution. </span></p>

This electoral process is legal in that it follows the same electoral process established in Article 7 of the Constitution, which created our government. Bernie has the organization and financial wherewith all to undertake this national election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the last couple decades, colleagues and I have drafted a legislative package, the Citizens Amendment to the Constitution and a Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, incorporating the same legislative procedures that govern the U.S. Senate and most legislative bodies. We have also thought through the tactics to circumvent the government to bring about its enactment as the law of the land.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The heart of our efforts is the six sections of the Citizens Amendment to the Constitution of the United States herein summarized:  </span></p>
<p><b>Section 1.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Asserts the authority of the people to establish an independent Legislature of the People with the power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions; </span><b>Section 2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Sanctions the national election and the enactment standard for the ratification of the Citizens Amendment and the enactment of the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act;   </span><b>Section 3.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Establishes a Citizens Trust with a board of Trustees and a director to conduct initiatives elections and administer legislative procedures on behalf of the People;   </span><b>Section 4.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Defines the standards to henceforth amend constitutions and charters, and the standards for enacting laws;  </span><b>Section 5.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Only natural persons can introduce initiatives and contribute funds for their enactment or defeat; and  </span><b>Section 6.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Establishes the power to enforce the Citizens Amendment in the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act and additional appropriate legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Sanders campaign organization is uniquely positioned to take control of the national electoral process for the enactment of the National Citizens Initiative. This will necessarily generate the cohesive grist needed to keep the Sanders movement from dissipating and will actually empower his supporters and all American citizens as legislators able to enact their social, economic and political agenda themselves. The cohesive force created by this undertaking will continue to impact governance policy long into the future to the horror of the 1%.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All that is required to buy into direct democracy is unreserved faith in the People, which most politicians and elites have little of. Or unreserved faith in the 1%</span></p>
<p><b>The decision is now Bernie’s and his supporters to make.</b></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his speech in Prague, President Obama&#8217;s rhetoric was essentially no different than that of George Bush. He promised, because of our &#8220;moral responsibility,&#8221; to rid the world of nuclear weapons. He then averred that the US would not lower its defenses while others are pursuing a nuclear threat.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s right about his last promise. Under his budget the US will continue to spend on defense (and a nuclear capability) more than all the rest of the world put together, &#8220;While others are pursuing a nuclear threat&#8221; an obvious reference to Iran, which our intelligence community reports is not pursuing a nuclear weapon. Obama who knows this intelligence information said to a cheering crowd: &#8220;As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-effective and proven.&#8221; So much for his recent peaceful overtures to the people of Iran whose defense budget is less than 1% of ours.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cost-effective!!!&#8221; The missile shield is the biggest boondoggle in military history with constant cost overruns. &#8220;Proven!!!&#8221; All tests have failed save one where the target&#8217;s location was programmed into the interceptor guidance system. The President&#8217;s false exaggerations are statements right out of a lobbyist&#8217;s briefing paper. The missile shield in Alaska was deployed before the system was ever proven to work at a cost of $100 billion. The shield for Poland and Czech will cost more than $100 billion. The great majority of knowledgeable scientists, not on the payroll of the benefiting defense contractors, state that the system will not work and that a threat does not exist.</p>
<p>When we are hemorrhaging debt at home in the current economic meltdown and tanking unemployment does this expenditure abroad make sense?  Barack sings a different tune when he&#8217;s abroad. His hawkish statements in Prague are as inaccurate as Bush&#8217;s were prior to the invasion of Iraq. Progressives are in for a lot more surprises to come.</p>
<p>The missile shield system has little to do with the phony nuclear threat from Iran or for that matter North Korea. It is the continuation of the arms race in space that started under the Clinton Administration. The missiles of the shield are really designed to shoot down orbiting communication satellites, thereby blinding and economically crippling a 21st Century enemy. But this can be done by any country that can launch a satellites. That&#8217;s why Western Analysts are so concerned with the ICBM rocket capability of Iran and North Korea. For them this capability is vital for their defense by raising the threshold costs of superpower intimidation. They well know that their rockets are not a system to attack the US superpower, Europe, South Korea or Japan, where at best they can only inflict recoverable damages. Any sane leader knows that such an attack would bring about a national suicide, easily inflicted by any one of the 19 plus US and NATO Trident submarines.</p>
<p>The arms race in space is now evolving into the Cold War posture of MAD (mutual assured destruction), the only beneficiaries of which are the arms contractors around the world. President Obama&#8217;s statements in Prague are Cold War, signaling that the military industrial complex (mic) investment in the political campaigns of the 2008 election will not only reap handsome rewards but will also insulate them from the pain of the present economic meltdown.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Obama&#8217;s touted policy shift toward Cuba is truly a disgrace and the details had to have been written by childish bureaucrats. Americans can make gifts to Cubans only if they are not communists. Be careful, you&#8217;d better check everyone’s registration before you send any gifts of  food or whatever.If you&#8217;re Cuban, visits are unlimited, that is, if you are visiting a second cousin or closer, or someone who lives with such a relative. Now, how is the State Department going to check this out? During your “visit” you can lay fiber-optic cable and engage in most kinds of telecommunications work but all other forms of business contacts remain off-limits.Nevertheless, Obama is making an improvement. Clinton permitted one visit per year, however, Bush restricted it to once every three years. But in an interesting twist, Obama continues an ethnic policy of a discriminatory nature. Suppose you don’t have a second cousin in Cuba and for that matter aren’t even Cuban, why can’t you visit Cuba like you can visit Vietnam. After all Vietnam is also a communist country on the other side of the globe which enjoys most favored trading nations status or visit China . A consistent foreign policy is too much to ask of our representative government.Our Cuban policy is a legacy of the cold war, long gone, like the size of our military budget. Obama promised us new leadership for both domestic and foreign policy; we have yet to see it. Don’t hold your breath.   mg</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>October 14th, 2009 by Robert Cottone</p>
<p>Until quite recently I did not believe that the “grand bargain” of President Lee Myung-bak was a viable negotiating option to persuade Pyongyang to denuclearize. Perhaps I was biased by the excess of his many grand gestures, particularly when upon ascendency to office President Lee abruptly terminated the 10-year Sunshine policy toward the people of North Korea. The Sunshine Policy had not altered the nature of “dear leader” Kim Jong-il’s rule of the DPRK, but it did provide an avenue for human relationships and kept the hope of unification alive.</p>
<p>The fifty-year stalemate on the Korean Peninsula calls for a new and different approach—something never tried before. Incremental approaches have worn themselves out. Lee Myung-bak is a big thinker and is not afraid of failure or ridicule in pursuing large visions. He may not always be right but when he is, great projects are realized. His “grand bargain” with North Korea may be an outsized vision for many to grasp; but were it to succeed it not only would bring peace to the Korean Peninsula, it would accelerate East Asia on a course of closer economic integration similar to that of the European community. A grandiose vision also called for by President Lee.</p>
<p>A “grand bargain,” as I understand it, includes (or should include):</p>
<ul>
<li> a peace treaty finally ending the Korean War of 1950-1953;</li>
<li> the mutual diplomatic recognition by all participants in the Korean War;</li>
<li> the removal of all sanctions against the DPRK and any of its citizens imposed by the United States (and countries induced by the US to sanction the DPRK), and imposed by the ROK and the United Nations;</li>
<li> the removal of all foreign troops and a treaty agreement against their reentry on both the Korean Peninsula and in Japan;</li>
<li>the removal of all nuclear weapons, weapons-grade uranium and plutonium, and the facilities to make such weapons and materials from the Korean Peninsula, and a treaty commitment by the DPRK and the ROK to prohibit its citizens from engaging in nuclear activities in other countries that could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons;</li>
<li>a Mutual Security Treaty under the auspices of the United Nations where the primary signators (South Korea, North Korea, Japan, China, Russia, and the United States) would guarantee the security, from invasion or subversion of the two nation states that occupy the Korean Peninsula.</li>
</ul>
<p>President Lee may have more or less the same elements of a “bargain,” but for sure the underlying theme of his “grand bargain” must be that the future of the Korean Peninsula rests primarily with the Korean people themselves&#8211;North and South&#8211;to work out their economic, cultural, and political differences in a secure, peaceful environment free of foreign meddling.</p>
<p>Thoughtful scholars publicly, and diplomats privately, the world over have characterized Lee Myung-bak “grand bargain” as naïve. It’s about as naïve as President Ronald Reagan’s burst of sanity at Reykjavik when he was out of reach of his diplomatic handlers in a private room with President Mikhail Gorbachev. How I wish national leaders were so “naïve” and demonstrated such visionary leadership and faith in their people.</p>
<p>After the April 5th North Korean space satellite launch, an inexperienced President Obama sought UN sanctions for an action that is legal for any nation to undertake. In fact, a short time later, South Korea launched a similar satellite prompting Kim Jong-il to inquire when the UN would sanction South Korea. The same foreign policy experts, who so poorly advised President Obama to seek sanctions at the UN against North Korea, are now undermining the “grand bargain” at the White House. Little wonder Pyongyang wants one-on-one negotiations with Washington, since they have seen little thus far from the Obama Administration to challenge Kim Jong-il negotiating skills.</p>
<p>President Obama can regain his footing in East Asia by aggressively backing Lee Myung-bak’s “grand bargain” and by making the only geopolitical move that could prove the sincerity of the key point of the bargain—the security guarantee to North Korea. The only proof that could possibly overcome Pyongyang’s paranoia to accept the “bargain” would be the unilateral withdrawal of all US forces from the Korean Peninsula&#8211;before the bargain is entered into. These forces are merely a legacy of the Korean War and do not relate to the real defense of South Korea. Militarily US forces are but a “trip wire.” No sane person contemplates refighting a 1950 style Korean War, with boots-on-the-ground up and down the peninsula, resulting in the devastation of one of the World’s 21st Century’s economic jewels.</p>
<p>The real defense of South Korea, and for that matter Japan, lies deep in Pacific waters with the awesome destructive power hardly spoken of at polite diplomatic receptions: the more than 100 missiles per Trident submarine on picket duty in East Asia. Only a few of these missiles could obliterate all of North Korea. Any nation initiating war in East Asia is essentially committing suicide because the military leadership of all stakeholders in East Asia and the world are well aware of the Trident capability.</p>
<p>In 1970-71 Republican President Richard Nixon unilaterally withdrew 20,000 of 60,000 troops in South Korea as part of his Detent Policy with the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. Credibility would dictate that any 21st Century “grand bargain” would have to include the withdrawal of American forces from the Korean Peninsula and Japan. Any substantial US Army presence in East Asia would be viewed as a security threat to the DPRK so long as American presidents, members of Congress, diplomats, and generals keep up the drumbeat of provocative and threatening statements about North Korea and its leaders.</p>
<p>I support President Lee’s vision and would only respectful suggest that he forego the implied threat in his use of the “this is your last chance” argument. It demeans his vision and resembles the pressure of a used-car salesman. The “grand bargain” is an opportunity&#8211;not a last chance. The more benefits the “bargain” offers to stakeholders the greater the likelihood the bargain will be struck.</p>
<p>Congratulations, President Lee, for securing the backing of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama of Japan and Premier Wen Jiabao of China for your “grand bargain.” Their support is vital to your undertaking. I hope they will join you in pressing President Obama to join in your collective efforts to not just meet and negotiate but to persuade Kim Jong-Il to accept your “grand bargain.”</p>
<p>I seriously doubt that without some unusual demonstration of commitment to the security of the DPKR, “grand bargain” negotiations will last longer than Lee Myung-bak has time remaining in office. That unusual demonstration can only come from the United States. President Obama can earn his Nobel Prize even before it is awarded later this year by calling for the unilateral withdrawal of all US forces from South Korea as prelude to the beginning of “grand bargain” negotiations and thereby demonstrate irrevocably the commitment of all parties to the security of North Korea. Such a demonstration just might push the “grand bargain” to become a reality.</p>
