								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rule of law is central to human governance. It is incumbent on those citizens who make the laws and those citizens who enjoy or suffer the consequences of laws to realize that lawmaking is the fundamental exercise of human self-governance. Its importance dictates that lawmaking be done deliberately and fully informs the constituents in the course of the lawmaking process.</p>
<p>The Legislative Procedures Act addresses this all-important issue: deliberative lawmaking. Below I analyze in detail the procedures and their relevance to the legislative process. What is self evident will not be commented uponThe text of the Act is in new times roman my comments and analysis are in Cambria. The Act is left justified while the comments are justified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE CITIZENS LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES ACT</p>
<p>An Act establishing legislative procedures and a Citizens Trust to administer the legislative procedures herein on behalf of the Legislature of the People so that individual citizens can deliberatively exercise their legislative powers; and adding to the Federal Code.</p>
<p>Be It Enacted By The Citizens Of The United States:</p>
<h1><a id="post-1443-__RefHeading__1146_1467228087"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc252225464"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc408491818"></a>Section 1. TITLE</h1>
<p>This act shall be known and may be cited as the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>The title and summary followed by Section1 emulate the format of bills in Congress.</h1>
<h1>Section 2. PREAMBLE</h1>
<p>We, the People of the United States, inherently possess the sovereign authority and power to govern ourselves. We asserted this power in our Declaration of Independence and in the ratification of our Constitution. We, the People, choose to participate as lawmakers in all government jurisdictions.</p>
<p>THEREFORE, We, the People, sanction the election conducted by the Philadelphia II organization and establish the number of votes necessary to ratify the Citizens Amendment and enact the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act as the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election, permitting Citizens to exercise their lawmaking powers, concurrent with the legislative powers we delegate to our elected representatives in all government jurisdictions.</p>
<p>AND THEREFORE, We, the People, enact this Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, to provide for the administration of the “Legislature of the People.”</p>
<p>The preamble is an important legislative element in that it defines the goal of the legislation and summaries its major elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-1443-__RefHeading__1150_1467228087"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc252225466"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc408491820"></a>Section 3. LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES</h1>
<p>The Citizens Trust (hereinafter “Trust”) shall qualify proposed legislation chronologically, limiting one initiative per week for each government jurisdiction. The Trust shall take advantage of contemporary technology in implementing these procedures so as to facilitate as much as possible the citizens’ legislative role. The essential elements of the legislative process include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>In the Congress the leader in each house determines when and if legislation will be taken up; something very partisan and unfair. Under the Act’s procedures no such tyranny is possible in that all legislation when qualified will be taken up chronologically; An improvement over Congress. The amount of time a citizen will be able to vote on issues is twenty-four hours a day for one week. Voters can be any where in the world and vote via the Internet. This voting procedure discredits the canard that the People’s legislature will be flooded with thousands bills. Acting on legislation will be limited to 52 weeks no such flood can take place. Citizens will be able to vote at the same time on 52 national issues, 52 state issues and 52 local issues.</p>
<p>A. Sponsors.</p>
<p>Only citizens of the United States who are natural persons registered to vote may introduce or sponsor legislation. The authors and sponsors shall be identified on the proposed legislation, on any qualifying petition, and on any qualifying poll. The Trust may grant special chronological consideration to legislation introduced by the President or by the directors of Philadelphia II.</p>
<p>B. Form.</p>
<p>Legislation shall comprise a Title, a Summary, a Preamble that states the subject and purposes of the legislation, and its complete text.</p>
<p>C. Content.</p>
<p>The legislation shall pertain to matters of public policy relevant to the government jurisdiction to which it is applicable. The Sponsors shall determine the wording of the Title and Summary subject to approval by the Trust.</p>
<p>D. Subject.</p>
<p>An initiative shall address only one subject but may include related or mutually dependent parts.</p>
<p>E. Word Limit.</p>
<p>An initiative shall contain no more than five thousand words, exclusive of the Title, Preamble, Summary, references, definitions and language that quotes existing law.</p>
<p>Items D and E are subject to a great deal of abuse in Congress and in state legislatures. If you can pack several issues into one piece of legislation you have the opportunity to sneak into enactment bad stuff. The unlimited length of legislation, sometimes hundred of pages also offers the opportunity for corruption. The Patriot Act of 9/11 is a great example. The five thousand-word-limit is a reasonable length to explain a single subject. Correcting these legislative abuses guarantees greater transparency to the process.</p>
<p>F. Qualification.</p>
<p>Following approval of the Title and Summary by the Trust, the proposed legislation may qualify for election in the relevant government jurisdiction when the subject matter described in the title and summary is approved by forty percent of respondents in a public opinion poll. To qualify, the polling plan, including the number of respondents, the methodology and the entity that will conduct the poll, shall be approved in advance by the Trust.</p>
<p>The theory behind requiring a poll is to make sure that there is broad interest in the subject matter beyond that of the sponsors. The threshold is 40 percent of the constituency must be willing to address the subject. This has the effect of limiting self-serving and crazy legislation. Polling is sophisticated and accurate.</p>
<p>G. Communications.</p>
<p>Once an initiative is qualified, the title, summary, preamble, text and the identity of its sponsors shall be published on an Internet website and in various mediums of communication. Additional information: the Hearing Record; the Deliberative Committee report; the result of the Legislative Advisory Vote; statements prepared by the Sponsors, other proponents and opponents; and a balanced analysis prepared by the Trust of the pros and cons of the initiative, including its costs and benefits and societal, environmental, and economic implications, shall be added to the publications on the legislation’s web page as this information becomes available. Here again the goal is total and continuous transparency.</p>
<p>The level of communications in the Legislative Procedures far exceeds that of Congress and state legislatures. Initially setting up a web site for each qualified proposed law provides a vehicle where the resulting steps in the legislative process are communicated to the public as they occur. Holding hearings on legislation is similar to that of all legislative bodies. In this case, however, the hearings will be compelled to be implement by the newest technology some of which has yet to be developed.</p>
<p>H. Public Hearing.</p>
<p>After an initiative qualifies for election, the Trust shall appoint a Hearing Officer to conduct a public hearing. Representatives of the initiative’s Sponsors and representatives of the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction shall participate in the hearing in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Trust. Testimony on the proposed law by proponents, opponents and experts shall be solicited, and their testimonies shall be published as the Hearing Record.</p>
<p>I. Deliberative Committee.</p>
<p>After the public hearings the Trust shall convene a Deliberative Committee demographically representing the government jurisdiction to review each initiative. The Deliberative Committee shall be drawn at random from a pool of citizens previously developed and maintained by the Trust. Each member of the Deliberative Committee shall be fairly compensated for time spent and expenses incurred in performance of Committee duties. The Trust shall provide technical support and such additional resources as are necessary for the effective discharge of the Committee&#8217;s duties. The Deliberative Committee shall review the Hearing Record, secure expert advice, deliberate the merits of the initiative, and prepare a written report of its deliberations and recommendations. By two-thirds vote, the Deliberative Committee may alter the Title, Summary, Preamble or text of the initiative, provided that the changes are consistent with the stated purposes of the initiative.</p>
<p>Existing legislatures operate under a committee system where proposed bills are referred after first reading (introduction). Committees give the legislation the needed scrutiny to determine if it is worthy of enactment after which it is referred to the full legislative body for a vote. This committee process to is vital to the deliberative process. It is not entirely replicable in the Legislature of the People. However, a Deliberative Committee is specifically designed to capture all of the elements of a committee system and then some.</p>
<p>J. Legislative Advisory Vote.</p>
<p>Each initiative, together with its Hearing Record and report of the Deliberative Committee, shall be transmitted to the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction. The legislative body shall conduct a public vote of its members, recording the yeas and nays on the initiative, within 90 days after receipt thereof. The vote of the legislative body is non-binding, serving only as an advisory to the citizens.</p>
<p>This vote is unique to the Legislature of the People. It is based on the fact that full time representatives in legislatures have special knowledge about the issues affecting their constituencies. That being the case it makes sense to avail ourselves of that knowledge via a public advisory vote on the proposed legislation under consideration. This is a mandatory requirement on government representatives and is the only area where the enactment of the Legislature of the People impinges on the independence of representative government’s legislative bodies. This information, published in the legislation web site, serves as an informative cue to the general public before a final vote is taken.</p>
<p>K. Promotional Communications.</p>
<p>Any communication, regardless of the medium through which conveyed, that promotes or opposes an initiative shall conspicuously identify the person(s) responsible for that communication, in a manner specified by the Trust.</p>
<p>L. Campaign Financing.</p>
<p>Only United States citizens may contribute funds, services or property in support of or in opposition to an initiative. Contributions from corporations including, but not limited to, such incorporated entities as industry groups, labor unions, political parties, political action committees, organized religious bodies and associations are specifically prohibited. Such entities are also prohibited from coercing or inducing employees, clients, customers, members, or any other associated persons to support or oppose an initiative. Violation of these prohibitions is a felony punishable by not more than one year in prison, or a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars, or both, per instance, applied to each person found guilty of the violation.</p>
<p>M. Financial Disclosure.</p>
<p>The Trust shall establish financial reporting requirements applicable to initiative sponsors, proponents and opponents. The Trust shall make all financial reports available to the public immediately upon its receipt thereof. Failure of sponsors, proponents or opponents to comply with these reporting requirements shall be a felony punishable by not more than one year in prison or a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars, or both, per instance, applied to each person found guilty of the violation.</p>
<p>N. Election.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the Legislative Advisory Vote, or 90 days after the initiative has been delivered to the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction for an advisory vote, whichever occurs first, the Trust shall publish a schedule for the election of the proposed bill and shall conduct an election in accordance with the published schedule. The Trust shall conduct all initiative elections employing the most effective and secure technology. The Trust shall administer an election that is available to the constituency in question for twenty-four hours a day for seven days. The Trust shall make voting on proposed legislation as convenient as possible using the newest secure technology.</p>
<p>This election process is considerably superior to existing elections held by representative governments, which suffer from extensive voter suppression. After the enactment of the Citizens Amendment and the accompanying Act, the role of voters participating in the election conducted by the Philadelphia II shall be turned over to the Citizens Trust as a foundation of it to set up a process where every voter in the United States is registered for life. The Citizens Trust will conduct every initiative election at every level of government. This will require the national disbursements of Trust offices across the nation. I anticipate that this electoral process will be so efficient and fair that the public will clamor that the Trust conduct all elections for representative government.</p>
<p>O. Enactment.</p>
<p>An initiative that creates or modifies a constitution or charter becomes law when it is approved by more than one-half the registered voters <a id="post-1443-__DdeLink__1161_1467228087"></a>of the relevant government jurisdiction in each of two successive elections. If the amendment is approved in the first election, a second ratification election shall occur no earlier than six months and no later than a year after the first election. An initiative that enacts, modifies or repeals a statute becomes the law when approved by more than half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction who participate in the election.</p>
<p>P. Effective Date.</p>
<p>The effective date of an initiative, if not otherwise specified in the initiative, shall be forty-five days after certification of its enactment by the Trust.</p>
<p>Q. Judicial Review.</p>
<p>No court shall have the power to enjoin any election within the Legislature of the People except on grounds of fraud. After an initiative or proposed bill has been enacted into law, courts, when requested, may determine the constitutionality of the law.</p>
<p>R. Withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Sponsors of an initiative may withdraw an initiative from further consideration and processing at any time prior to a deadline established by the Trust.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Section 1.   The sovereign authority of the People of the United States, vested in an independent "Legislature of the People" wherein individual citizens can exercise their legislative power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions via local, state and national legislation, shall not be denied or abridged by any federal, state]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Section 1</strong>.   The sovereign authority of the People of the United States, vested in an independent &#8220;Legislature of the People&#8221; wherein individual citizens can exercise their legislative power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions via local, state and national legislation, shall not be denied or abridged by any federal, state or local government of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>The technology today permits us to simply asks the American people via a national election if they wish to create a “Legislature of the People” wherein they as individual citizens will be able to make laws, amend constitutions and charters in a deliberative process based on the legislative procedures enacted in companion legislation: Legislative Procedures Act.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2.  </strong> The citizens of the United States hereby sanction the national election conducted by the Philadelphia II organization and hereby establish the number of votes necessary to ratify this Citizens Amendment, and enact the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, as the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition to creating a Legislature of the People will question the legitimacy of the Philadelphia II national election that permits citizens to vote on such an enactment because there is no reference of this power in the Constitution.  Article VII, the creation part of the Constitution, was legally in violation of the Confederate Constitution, which mandated that any change must be by unanimous agreement thereby making the Philadelphia Constitution on its surface illegal. Article. VII “The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.” This article created our present government. It was made legal by the acceptance of the leaders in state governments of the Confederacy. Once the nine states acted under the dictates of Article VII, three additional states followed within the year. The political leaders opposed to the Philadelphia Constitution could have continued their opposition –– their case being legally superior to the Article VII process. However, that’s not what happened. Opposition faded away in the short course of time. In fact, elite opponents just caved in. They knew the Confederation was unraveling putting their political power and their property interests at risk. The opponents of the Philadelphia II election should expect the same melting away since they would find themselves in opposition to 70 to 80 million or more citizens who consciously voted to empower themselves by creating a “Legislature of the People.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3.</strong>   A Citizens Trust is hereby created to administer the legislative procedures created by the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act and to conduct elections of proposed legislation at all levels of government. A Board of Trustees and a Director shall govern the Citizens Trust. The Citizens Legislative Procedures Act defines the composition of the Board of Trustees and their election, their duties and responsibilities; and the duties, responsibilities and the selection process of the Director.</p>
<p><strong>All legislative bodies require an agency to manage the conduct of administrative services for the smooth operation of the legislative body. The agency in question conducts the research and the management of parliamentary procedures during the course of legislative debates and the bill’s enactment. The Agency is responsible for the enrollment of bills and the management of their progress through the deliberative legislative process.  The agency is also responsibly to secure and manage all of the recourses and supplies required for the operation of the legislatures. The U.S. Senate Secretary fulfills these legislative responsibilities. The same requirement exists for the smooth operation of the People’s Legislature and to address the administrative and physical resource needs of the people now acting as legislative lawmakers. In addition to the normal operations of a legislative body the people’s Trust must conduct national, state and local elections every calendar week. Citizen voters will have one week 24 hours a day to vote on legislation dealing with issues germane to the federal, state or local levels of government. The effect of this voting pattern is to limit action on initiative bills at each level of government to 52 per year. Legislation not taken up in the year of its introduction is held over to be processed chronologically in subsequent years. The Trust is responsible for registering all eligible voters for life. A Citizens Trust is herein created to administer and manages the legislative procedures enacted by the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act. The Act addresses in great detail all of the procedures for the smooth operation of the people’s legislature. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 4.</strong>   Legislation created under the authority of this Amendment that amends the Constitution of the United States or the constitution of any state, or the charter of any local government, becomes law when approved by more than one-half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction in each of two successive elections. If the amendment is approved in the first election, a second ratification election shall occur no earlier than six months and no later than a year after the first election. An initiative that enacts, modifies or repeals a statute becomes law when approved by more than one-half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction who participate in the election.</p>
<p><strong>The standard to amend constitutions and charters is purposely made difficult because these amendments are to the foundational documents creating government entities.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 5.</strong></p>
<p>An appropriation is hereby authorized from the Treasury of the United States to fund the initial and subsequent annual costs of operating the Legislature of the People and the Citizens Trust to meet its responsibilities defined in the Legislative Procedures Act. The sum appropriated shall equal the sum appropriated to fund the annual operations of Congress.</p>
<p><strong>The appropriation process originates in the House of Representatives. It would be a simple task for elites to pressure the members of the House to deny the funds necessary for the operation of Legislature of the People. Suing the House to act will throw the issue to the Supreme Court playing into the hands of elites. By appropriating the necessary funds in a constitutional amendment we avoid an imbroglio with the House and the Supreme Court. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 6.</strong></p>
<p>Only natural persons who are citizens of the United States may introduce legislation, contribute funds, services or property in support or in opposition to initiatives in the Legislature of the People.</p>
<p><strong>One of the most corrupting elements of our capitalistic society is the legal treatment –– established by the Supreme Court –– of corporations as natural persons investing the corporate entity with the power of free speech thereby introducing the wealth of corporations, under the direct control of elites, to further control governments and society. This corruption is denied access to the legislative process of the Legislature of the People by including its prohibition in this amendment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 7.</strong></p>
<p>Citizens shall have the power to enforce the provisions of this Amendment and the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act. No United States court may enjoin an initiative election except on grounds of fraud.</p>
<p><strong>This section is boilerplate articulated in a number of amendments to the Constitution. It reinforces the sovereign power of the people to defend and enforce the enactment of the Citizens Amendment and the Legislative Procedures Act herein enacted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CITIZENS AMENDMENT to the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED STATES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong>.   The sovereign authority of the People of the United States, vested in an independent &#8220;Legislature of the People&#8221; wherein individual citizens can exercise their legislative power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions via local, state and national initiatives, shall not be denied or abridged by any federal, state or local government of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2.  </strong> The citizens of the United States hereby sanction the national election conducted by the Philadelphia II organization and hereby establish the number of votes necessary to ratify this Citizens Amendment, and enact the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, as the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.</strong>   A Citizens Trust is hereby created to administer the legislative procedures created by the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act and to conduct elections of proposed legislation at all levels of government.

<p>It is hard to give up something you claim you never had. That is the 
difficulty Americans face with respect to their country’s empire. Since 
the era of Theodore Roosevelt, politicians, journalists, and even some 
historians have deployed euphemisms—“expansionism,” “the large policy,” 
“internationalism,” “global leadership”—to disguise America’s imperial 
ambitions. According to the exceptionalist creed embraced by both 
political parties and most of the press, imperialism was a European 
venture that involved seizing territories, extracting their resources, 
and dominating their (invariably dark-skinned) populations. Americans, 
we have been told, do things differently: they bestow self-determination
 on backward peoples who yearn for it. The refusal to acknowledge that 
Americans have pursued their own version of empire—with the same 
self-deceiving hubris as Europeans—makes it hard to see that the US 
empire might (like the others) have a limited lifespan. All empires 
eventually end, but maybe an exceptional force for global good could 
last forever—or so its champions seem to believe.</p>



<p>The refusal to 
contemplate the scaling back of empire shuts down what ought to be our 
most urgent foreign policy debate before it has even begun. That is why 
these two new books are so necessary, and so welcome: they are the most 
serious efforts since Chalmers Johnson’s <em>Blowback</em> series (2004–2010) to reopen the question of American empire by taking for granted that it exists. Victor Bulmer-Thomas’s<em> Empire in Retreat</em>
 maintains that America has harbored imperial ambitions since its 
founding, and argues that its focus shifted in the twentieth century, 
from acquiring territory to penetrating foreign countries and 
influencing their governments to support US strategic and economic 
interests. David Hendrickson’s <em>Republic in Peril</em> sees that shift as the result of a decisive embrace of interventionism, aimed at extending US power throughout the world.</p>



<p>Both
 authors think withdrawal from overextended military commitments could 
strengthen America. Bulmer-Thomas, a British diplomat and scholar, 
recommends it as a pragmatic adjustment to shrinking support for US 
empire at home and abroad. Hendrickson, a political scientist at 
Colorado College, provides a theoretical rationale for it, exploring the
 possibility of what he calls a new internationalism, based on respect 
for the sovereignty of other nations. Yet even as they catalog the many 
signs of imperial decline (economic, political, cultural), neither is 
sanguine that American policymakers can manage a graceful retreat.</p>



<p>Bulmer-Thomas
 begins by recounting the rise of the US territorial empire. He shows 
that America’s relationship with the land it acquired during westward 
expansion resembled the relationship between European countries and 
their colonies abroad. The United States, like European colonial powers,
 subjugated (and nearly exterminated) aboriginal populations; used 
military occupation as a buffer between white settlers and rebellious 
natives; and established only limited representative governments in 
their occupied territories. One resident of America’s territories 
complained that they were treated like “mere colonies, occupying much 
the same relation to the General Government as the colonies did to the 
British government prior to the Revolution.”</p>



<p>Most textbooks date 
the beginning of America’s overseas expansion to 1898, when it acquired 
sovereignty over Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines after the 
conclusion of its war with Spain. Yet as Bulmer-Thomas shows, the US 
empire went offshore much earlier. During the 1810s and 1820s, Americans
 carved out the state of Liberia in West Africa, allegedly as a refuge 
for free American blacks; the country in fact functioned as an American 
colony and later as a protectorate of the Firestone Rubber Company. The 
US established an imperial presence in East Asia as early as 1844, when 
the Treaty of Wanghia gave it the same privileged access to Chinese 
ports as the British Empire, and went on to acquire dozens of “guano 
islands” in the Pacific, where abundant bird droppings provided a rich 
source of fertilizer.</p>



<p>During the 1890s, the 
American zeal for distant acquisitions slipped into high gear, as 
politicians realized they were arriving late to the imperial game. Led 
by Theodore Roosevelt and other advocates of expansion, they sought land
 through annexation and collaboration with American business interests 
(Hawaii) as well as through war with Spain. These acquisitions began as 
additions to the territorial empire but gradually acquired a more 
ambiguous character. They came to form the foundation of what 
Bulmer-Thomas calls America’s “semi-global empire,” built not on 
territorial acquisition but on the maintenance of client states and 
various other forms of international interference, including military 
bases that supported occasional armed interventions in local conflicts 
and multinational corporations run mostly by Americans.</p>



<p>The 
Philippines offers a case in point of America’s nonterritorial form of 
empire. The US declared war on Spain in 1898 with the avowed intention 
of ending Spanish rule in Cuba, but even before the declaration 
President William McKinley had dispatched the US Asiatic Squadron under 
Commodore George Dewey to Hong Kong in preparation for an assault on the
 Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. As soon as war was declared, Dewey moved 
quickly and crushed the Spanish forces. Their surrender emboldened the 
Filipino rebels, who erroneously assumed that the US had arrived to 
liberate them from their Spanish oppressors. The US military quickly 
disabused them of that delusion by embarking on a ferocious 
counterinsurgency campaign, which lasted for years and included the 
systematic torture and slaughter of Filipinos. As many as 250,000 died, 
but the US imperialists never doubted the sanctity of their cause. 
“Nothing can be more preposterous than the proposition that these men 
were entitled to receive from us sovereignty over the entire country 
which we were invading,” Secretary of War Elihu Root said in 1900 about 
the Filipino rebels. “As well the friendly Indians, who have helped us 
in our Indian wars, might have claimed the sovereignty of the West.”</p>



<p>Statehood
 was never considered during the debate over the Philippines: the only 
question was whether to establish a naval base at Manila and give the 
islands back to the Spanish or to annex the entire archipelago. The 
imperialists won the argument, and after the insurgents were finally 
suppressed the Philippines became a colony, from which investors in 
sugar, hemp, tobacco, and coconut oil could gain privileged access to US
 markets and Filipinos could emigrate to America in search of jobs. By 
the 1930s, congressional opposition to cheap exports as well as to cheap
 (and nonwhite) labor created support for Philippine independence, which
 was finally achieved in 1946. But it came with so many restrictions on 
trade and so much preferential treatment for American investors—not to 
mention continued maintenance of US military bases—that “it would be 
more accurate to describe the Philippines as becoming a US 
protectorate,” Bulmer-Thomas writes. “Thus, the end of colonialism in 
the Philippines did not mean the end of US imperial control.”</p>



<p>A 
similar pattern of indirect imperial control also applied to Central 
America and the Caribbean. The US dominated that region during the 
twentieth century through colonies (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
 Panama Canal Zone), but more broadly by using its economic influence to
 interfere in domestic politics and maintain governments that would 
faithfully serve American interests (as was the case in Cuba until 
1959), or by establishing asymmetrical bilateral treaties and customs 
receiverships—the collection of customs duties by US officials, who then
 used the money to pay off the debt service owed on American loans. This
 arrangement survived in the Dominican Republic until 1942 and in Haiti 
until 1947.</p>



<p>Military interventions underwrote economic domination.
 Sometimes this involved sending in the US Marines and leaving them in 
place for decades, as in Haiti from 1915 to 1934. Sometimes it required 
using military force to crush a rebellion and arranging for the 
emergence of a cooperative dictator, such as Rafael Trujillo in the 
Dominican Republic, whose brutalities the Americans tolerated as long as
 he respected US strategic interests in the region. This he did for 
thirty years, until his attempt in 1960 to overthrow the Venezuelan 
government cost him US support. Sensing an opportunity, his opponents 
assassinated him. But the US was still committed to maintaining the 
imperial relationship, and President Lyndon Johnson sent in the Marines 
in 1965 to prevent the left-of-center president Juan Bosch (who had been
 ousted by a military coup) from returning to power.</p>



<p>Johnson’s
 intervention recalled the conflicts of the early twentieth century, but
 during World War II and the cold war, US imperial strategies had begun 
to shift. As the USSR consolidated its power, the US scaled back its 
pursuit of territory abroad. Instead, it extended its imperial reach 
through the development of international institutions that would serve 
its interests but could not also be used against it. At Bretton Woods in
 1944, the US initiated the creation of the <abbr>IMF</abbr> and the 
World Bank. Both institutions are headquartered in Washington, and the 
president of the World Bank has always been an American, by custom if 
not fiat.</p>



<p>The Point Four Program, drawn from Harry Truman’s 
inaugural address in 1949, linked the World Bank to the struggle with 
the Soviet Union for influence in the developing world, where the bank 
would make loans, with many political conditions attached, to 
governments and state-owned enterprises (later privately owned ones as 
well). The requirement that Congress approve these loans ensured that 
they would reflect what the US government considered its national 
interest. The United Nations, too, began as an American-dominated 
institution, though as its membership grew it became progressively 
harder for the US to control. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and bilateral treaties worldwide 
also served American policy under the guise of “collective security” 
against the Soviet threat.</p>



<p>All these arrangements were fortified 
by the principle articulated in the Truman Doctrine of 1947—that 
aggression must be stopped everywhere. Such a commitment “assumes that 
foreign conflicts feature evil aggressors and innocent victims,” as 
Hendrickson writes. This unexamined assumption was endorsed and promoted
 by leaders from both political parties, who helped sustain an 
atmosphere of perpetual moral crisis during the cold war. The US, 
working through the <abbr>CIA</abbr>, helped to overthrow elected 
left-leaning governments in Iran, Guatemala, Congo, Brazil, and Chile. 
Interventions anywhere could always be rationalized as 
counterinterventions against the allegedly omnipresent Soviet threat.</p>



<p>When
 the cold war ended, the US’s geopolitical rationale for military 
interventionism—the need to contain communism—swiftly disappeared, as 
the country found itself in the heady position of being the world’s sole
 superpower. This was what is now viewed, with some nostalgia, as the 
unipolar moment. And yet even in the absence of its longtime ideological
 rival, the United States continued to conduct foreign policy with the 
same moral fervor that had informed its actions in the cold war, and 
with the same confidence that it was a force for global good.</p>



<p>Under
 the presidency of Bill Clinton, much of official Washington began to 
believe “that US empire would best be served by the promotion of 
democracy abroad—or at least an American version of democracy—on the 
grounds that US security, free market economies and democracies are 
mutually reenforcing,” as Bulmer-Thomas writes. The rationale for 
democracy promotion, in the words of Clinton’s first National Security 
Strategy, was that “democratic states are less likely to threaten our 
interests and more likely to cooperate with the US to meet security 
threats and promote sustainable development.” This formulation could 
work in some circumstances, but not all. Other nations could have good 
reasons to see democracy promotion as a form of aggression, as Russia 
did when Clinton sought to expand <abbr>NATO</abbr> eastward despite the
 promises made by his predecessors in the first Bush administration and 
the warnings of many seasoned diplomats, led by George Kennan.</p>



<p>Establishing
 “US hegemony across the globe,” in Bulmer-Thomas’s words, was not only 
about promoting democracy abroad but also about maintaining military 
supremacy everywhere. In 2000, despite cuts in personnel and the closure
 of many US bases, the Defense Department committed itself to the 
pursuit of “full spectrum dominance.” This goal, outlined in <em>Joint Vision 2020</em>,
 the Department of Defense’s blueprint for the future, meant the 
worldwide control of land, sea, air, and space, including cyberspace.</p>



<p>The
 triumphalist mood following the end of the cold war also emboldened 
neoconservative ideologues. Two of them, William Kristol and Robert 
Kagan, founded the Project for the New American Century in 1997. Its 
“Statement of Principles” pledged to “rally support for American global 
leadership” through “a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral 
clarity.” This was nothing if not an exceptionalist, even unilateralist 
creed, based on faith in the uniqueness of America’s position as a 
global leader. It evoked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s claim 
that the US was “the indispensable nation.”</p>



<p>The 
neoconservatives found their president in George W. Bush. Even before 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Bush began to implement 
neoconservative policies, withdrawing from international organizations 
and agreements—including (in June 2002) the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty with Russia. This decision, according to Ivo Daalder of the 
Brookings Institution and other critics at the time, signaled a swerve 
in US nuclear strategy from deterrence to “war-fighting.”</p>



<p>The 
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon provided a new 
enemy, international terrorism, that was even more shadowy and elusive 
than international communism had been. Widespread panic among Americans 
and their allies was taken (especially in the US) to justify a permanent
 state of emergency, with damaging consequences for civil liberties and 
public debate at home, as well as for the many thousands of civilians 
who would become “collateral damage” in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p>After
 September 11, new rationales for military intervention abroad 
emerged—not only preventative war against terror (the false 
justification for invading Iraq) but also <abbr>R2P</abbr> (the Responsibility to Protect). As Hendrickson shows, <abbr>R2P</abbr>
 originated in the recommendation of a Canadian government commission 
and received a modified but contested acceptance by the UN in 2005. <abbr>R2P</abbr>
 provides a virtually blank check for using force on humanitarian 
grounds—an idea that has little support from non-Western nations. In 
practice it vitiates a central assumption of international law—that each
 state has the right to defend itself. In his second inaugural address, 
Bush spelled out the vision of universal empire behind <abbr>R2P</abbr>: “The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.” This was the Truman Doctrine on steroids.</p>



<p>Hendrickson
 thinks American disregard for international law helps explain the 
incoherence of contemporary strategic thought. According to 
exceptionalist ideology, the US is the primary guardian of international
 law, on which global stability depends. Yet Hendrickson (like 
Bulmer-Thomas) makes clear that more often than not, the putative 
rule-maker has in fact broken rules and acted in ways that it would not 
tolerate from any other nation.</p>



<p>The American exceptionalist double
 standard is especially apparent in its current military operations 
overseas. Consider the battle-ready presence of the US Navy in the South
 China Sea. Imagine a rival power behaving as aggressively in the 
Caribbean, lecturing us on our misdeeds (as we have lectured the 
Chinese) and appointing itself a neutral umpire for the region. A 
retired Chinese admiral, quoted by Hendrickson, puts the matter 
succinctly: the US Navy in East Asia is like “a man with a criminal 
record ‘wandering just outside the gates of a family home.’”</p>



<p>Or take the confrontation emerging on the western border of Russia. The missile defense system installed by <abbr>NATO</abbr> on Russia’s doorstep, combined with <abbr>NATO</abbr>
 troops conducting military exercises, could not be more provocative. No
 great power, least of all the United States, would allow deployments so
 close to its borders without protest and (probably) retaliation.</p>



<p>While
 Bulmer-Thomas treats imperial expansion as a continuous feature of 
American history that has run afoul of historical circumstance, 
Hendrickson reconstructs an anti-imperial tradition in Anglophone 
thought, which he calls “liberal pluralism” and recommends reviving in 
view of our crumbling American empire. In his view, liberal pluralism 
was embodied in the system of European nation-states (the “Westphalian 
system”) that emerged from the Thirty Years’ War. It was also the 
worldview of America’s founders, uniting Washington, Jefferson, 
Hamilton, and Madison in their suspicion of military adventures abroad. 
From the liberal pluralist perspective, war is the <em>summum malum</em> 
of international affairs; respect for the sovereignty of other nations 
is the best way to avoid it. Sovereignty is the core of international 
law: every state has the right to defend itself from external attack; 
none has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another.</p>



<p>The  fact that liberal pluralism discourages interference does not, however,  imply that it encourages nations to be passive bystanders in the face  of immoral foreign policies, as contemporary political theorists who  favor an interventionist approach like to claim. Liberal pluralism “does  not,” Hendrickson insists, “dictate indifference to human rights”; it  allows states to shelter dissidents and welcome refugees from  oppression. “What it does not allow is coercive intervention in a  foreign country to secure those rights.”</p>

<p>Hendrickson concentrates his criticisms on the reckless use of 
military force in foreign lands; he does not dismiss economic sanctions 
as an alternative. Nor does he rule out interference in extreme 
situations, such as the threat of genocide. But he insists that such 
interventions be—as far as possible—multilateral, peaceful, and 
respectful of international law. He proposes maintaining <abbr>NATO</abbr>,
 but with our nuclear guarantees to its members on a strictly 
“no-first-use” basis; preserving friendships with allies but also 
working out “rules of the road with putative adversaries.” He argues 
that fighting terrorism requires effective policing at home and the 
support of functioning governments abroad, not their overthrow. The 
liberal pluralist tradition, in his view, provides intellectual 
resources for reducing international tension and redirecting national 
wealth toward urgently necessary aims—rebuilding infrastructure, 
reviving the welfare state, and addressing the menace of climate change 
and oceanic catastrophe.</p>



<p>In recent years, popular 
support for imperial adventures has waned. Large majorities have opposed
 sending US troops to Libya, Syria, and Ukraine. The percentage of 
Americans who think it is “very important” that the US should “maintain 
superior military power worldwide” dropped from 68 percent in 2002 to 52
 percent in 2014. And poll respondents ranked military supremacy sixth 
out of ten among foreign policy aims. The top-ranked goal was 
“protecting the jobs of American workers.”</p>



<p>The shift in public 
opinion is a response to a series of failed interventions: efforts at 
regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria have left behind chaos, failed 
states, terrorist recruits, and endless war. But whatever disagreements 
they may have had over policy details, all three presidents since 
September 11 have shared a commitment to US global military supremacy. 
No major policymaker wants to admit publicly what many suspect 
privately: that America’s imperial reach has begun to exceed its grasp. 
Barring a dramatic shift in public discourse, the American empire will 
not go gentle into that good night; more likely it will, as Dylan Thomas
 counseled the old, “burn and rave at close of day.”</p>



<p>No one burns 
and raves more flagrantly than Donald Trump. The failure of blank-check 
interventions fed the discontent he exploited in the 2016 campaign. Yet 
his chauvinist posturing has turned out to be little more than a 
belligerent, unhinged version of the militarized globalism he claimed to
 displace. So Trump lurches from one outrageous provocation to another 
while most of his critics repeat the stale formulas of global 
leadership. Neither side seems to notice that the rest of the world does
 not want to be led (though some countries may still want their security
 to be guaranteed by US power). More and more foreign countries are 
trying to go about their business on their own, even in areas once 
assumed to be vital to the US national interest—Latin America, the 
Middle East, the South China Sea, even the Korean peninsula, where the 
South Koreans have done what American leaders were unable or unwilling 
to do: initiate diplomacy with North Korea.</p>



<p>Other pillars of 
American power are also crumbling, as Bulmer-Thomas demonstrates in 
detail. Multinational corporations are no longer as dependent on 
American policies abroad for access to foreign markets; General Motors, 
for example, now sells more cars in China than anywhere else on earth, 
without benefit of a US presence there. Recent years have seen a steady 
fall in the US net investment ratio (gross investment less the 
consumption of fixed capital), both private and public. The consequence 
has been a decline in infrastructure (including public education), as 
well as a slowing of innovation and productivity. At the same time, 
neoliberal politicians in both parties, committed to cutting back the 
“entitlements” provided by the welfare state and privatizing the public 
sector, have underwritten the rise of inequality and social immobility. 
The effect has been to undermine the broad prosperity that was the 
domestic basis of the semi-global empire.</p>



<p>International institutions, rather than reinforcing American hegemony, challenge it. The UN, the <abbr>IMF</abbr>,
 and the World Bank have all proven unreliable in promoting US 
interests. At the UN, the US is more isolated than ever on the Security 
Council, as the dramatic increase in American vetoes shows. Various 
countries have learned to avoid borrowing from the <abbr>IMF</abbr>, 
with the onerous conditions it imposes, by building up their foreign 
exchange reserves and paying off existing debts. The World Bank now has 
two significant rivals, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the
 New Development Bank (which represents the <abbr>BRICS</abbr> 
countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The 
Organization of American States has been superseded, since 2011, by the 
Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, which insisted on the 
inclusion of Cuba despite US opposition. China is creating its own 
version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without US participation, as 
well as expanding into sub-Saharan Africa and cutting a deal with 
Nicaragua for another isthmian canal.</p>



<p>Yet Trump and his opponents 
in the Washington consensus still envision a unipolar world, where the 
United States can ignore the legitimate claims of rival nations and do 
pretty much whatever it wants, whether because of its sheer greatness 
(Trump) or its exceptional goodness (Clinton et al.). Obama was cautious
 about intervening in Syria and eager to negotiate with Iran, but his 
administration maintained or intensified commitments to global military 
supremacy, blanket surveillance, targeted drone assassinations, and 
modernization of nuclear weapons, as well as engagement in the Middle 
East and East Asia. Fundamental policies persisted despite Obama’s 
misgivings.</p>



<p>Neither Bulmer-Thomas nor Hendrickson believes these  policies can continue without catastrophe. And it might, in any case,  not be in the US’s interests for them to continue. As Bulmer-Thomas  reminds us, “Imperial retreat is not the same as national decline, as  many other countries can attest. Indeed, imperial retreat can strengthen  the nation-state just as imperial expansion can weaken it.” Yet as  Hendrickson concludes, “It is crystal clear that the empire is fully  determined to stick around,” despite our desperate need to dismantle it.  The drift of global events may eventually require the United States to  acknowledge the reality of a multipolar world, but we cannot assume that  the process will be peaceful. Still, Hendrickson has performed an  urgently necessary service in reconstructing the liberal pluralist  tradition. He reminds us that there is a humane alternative to  contemporary orthodoxy, if we can only recognize it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former Democratic senator who entered the classified “Pentagon Papers” into the Congressional Record, making them public, says House Intelligence Committee Republicans are cowards if they let the executive branch block release of a memo on alleged surveillance abuse.</p>
<p>Former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska said Republicans on the committee would demonstrate “the height of cowardice” if they abandon efforts to release the memo after voting to do so Monday evening.</p>
<div class="connatix_player float-left mr-2 hidden-print"></div>
<p>Gravel said lawmakers should be willing to unilaterally release classified documents if they feel it&#8217;s in the public interest, as he did with the secret Vietnam War study.</p>
<p>“The criteria for releasing anything is this: Is this something the people should know? If the Republicans feel this should be made public for the benefit of their constituents, fine, release it. The Democrats should do the same. But there is no argument to be made this stuff is secret and it’s too important for the people to know,” Gravel said after the committee voted along party lines for release.</p>
<p>“I’m not advocating it be done by the man on the street,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I’m advocating this be done by people who are duly elected and sworn to protect the Constitution. We cannot have a vibrant democracy if the American people don’t know what the government is doing.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department said last week that release of the memo would be “extraordinarily reckless” without executive branch review. Democrats who have read the document say it is misleading and risks unmasking important secrets.</p>
<p>Still, House Intelligence Committee Republicans voted for the release and started a five-day waiting period, during which President Trump can object to release. The memo is believed to address Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act-related activities pertaining to the 2016 Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t object, we can <div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

						[publish]. If he objects, we can refer it for a vote of the full House,” a House Intelligence Committee Republican source said late last week.</p>
<p>Gravel said Republicans should not back down if they meet resistance from administration officials.</p>
<p>“For the Congress to be a bunch of wimps and cowards and defer to the executive branch because they don’t want to take any responsibility is the height of cowardice,” he said.</p>
<p>In June 1971, Gravel convened a subcommittee he chaired and released thousands of pages of the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record, ensuring they would remain public as the Nixon administration challenged in court the right to report on the leaked document.</p>
<p>“All this brouhaha between the executive and the legislative is ridiculous. It’s all because these people don’t understand their responsibility under the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause,” Gravel said. “There is no legal risk on their part for releasing information they feel the public should know. No risk. Period.”</p>
<p>Gravel won the 1972 Supreme Court case Gravel v. U.S., with justices finding the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause immunized not only his release of the classified records, but also covered the participation of his staff.</p>
<p>The memo on alleged FISA abuse has resulted in notable party unity in the House, where debates on surveillance often are characterized by bipartisan pushes for privacy protections against a bipartisan consensus in favor of the status quo among leadership.</p>
<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a longtime FISA reform advocate, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/leading-fisa-critics-in-congress-split-along-party-lines-on-release-the-memo-push/article/2647126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>Examiner</em></a> last week she read the short memo and felt it should not be released. She said it “was crafted in a way that would create a misimpression based on classified information that I’ve reviewed long ago and cites sources that are highly classified.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lofgren said release would set up a secondary fight for release of the highly classified underpinnings.</p>
<p>“I can’t talk about this memo, but I think — critical as I’ve been about a lack of a warrant requirement [for domestic communications under FISA] — there still are things that shouldn’t be published. We have spies; they have spies. To think every single thing that has been done by intelligence agencies should be published, I think, is incorrect,” she said.</p>
<p>On the Republican side, there’s been a groundswell of support for release among rank-and-file members, many of whom shared their demands for release under the social media hashtag #ReleasetheMemo last week.</p>
<p>Members of the House are allowed to read the memo, but senators, including those on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have complained about not having access. House members who read the memo must do so in a secure room supervised by committee staff.</p>
<p>Although Lofgren said “it was not a long memo,” she questioned how a member of Congress would sneak a copy out of the secure reading room.</p>
<p>Gravel said even if lawmakers are guarded in the reading room, they can easily find a way to sneak a copy into a press release or official proceeding.</p>
<p>“Obviously then they have to be intelligent enough to get a copy of the document,” he said. “This is ridiculous, the Congress does leak like a sieve and if a person is intelligent and intent on releasing this information, it’s not that difficult. They just pretend it is to cover their backsides.”</p>

<p>By Ray McGovern</p>
<p>Russia-gate is becoming FBI-gate, thanks to the official release of unguarded text messages between loose-lipped FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and his garrulous girlfriend, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. (Ten illustrative texts from their exchange appear at the end of this article.)</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">
</div>
<p>Despite his former job as chief of the FBI’s counterintelligence section, Strzok had the naive notion that texting on FBI phones could not be traced. Strzok must have slept through “Security 101.” Or perhaps he was busy texting during that class. Girlfriend Page cannot be happy at being misled by his assurance that using office phones would be a secure way to conduct their affair(s).</p>
<p>It would have been unfortunate enough for Strzok and Page to have their adolescent-sounding texts merely exposed, revealing the reckless abandon of star-crossed lovers hiding (they thought) secrets from cuckolded spouses, office colleagues, and the rest of us. However, for the never-Trump plotters in the FBI, the official release of just a fraction (375) of almost 10,000 messages does incalculably more damage than that.</p>
<p>We suddenly have documentary proof that key elements of the U.S. intelligence community were trying to short-circuit the U.S. democratic process. And that puts in a new and dark context the year-long promotion of Russia-gate. It now appears that it was not the Russians trying to rig the outcome of the U.S. election, but leading officials of the U.S. intelligence community, shadowy characters sometimes called the Deep State.</p>
<p>More of the Strzok-Page texting dialogue is expected to be released. And the Department of Justice Inspector General reportedly has additional damaging texts from others on the team that Special Counsel Robert Mueller selected to help him investigate Russia-gate.</p>
<p>Besides forcing the removal of Strzok and Page, the text exposures also sounded the death knell for the career of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, in whose office some of the plotting took place and who has already announced his plans to retire soon.</p>
<p>But the main casualty is the FBI’s 18-month campaign to sabotage candidate-and-now-President Donald Trump by using the Obama administration’s Russia-gate intelligence “assessment,” electronic surveillance of dubious legality, and a salacious dossier that could never pass the smell test, while at the same time using equally dubious techniques to immunize Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers from crimes that include lying to the FBI and endangering secrets.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Strzok-Page texts provide something that the Russia-gate investigation has been sorely lacking: first-hand evidence of both corrupt intent and action. After months of breathless searching for “evidence” of Russian-Trump collusion designed to put Trump in the White House, what now exists is actual evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration colluded to keep Trump out of the White House – proof of what old-time gumshoes used to call “means, motive and opportunity.”</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately for Russia-gate enthusiasts, the FBI lovers’ correspondence provides factual evidence exposing much of the made-up “Resistance” narrative – the contrived storyline that <em>The New York Times</em> and much of the rest of the U.S. mainstream media deemed fit to print with little skepticism and few if any caveats, a scenario about brilliantly devious Russians that not only lacks actual evidence – relying on unverified hearsay and rumor – but doesn’t make sense on its face.</p>
<p>The Russia-gate narrative always hinged on the preposterous notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin foresaw years ago what no American political analyst considered even possible, the political ascendancy of Donald Trump. According to the narrative, the fortune-telling Putin then risked creating even worse tensions with a nuclear-armed America that would – by all odds – have been led by a vengeful President Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Besides this wildly improbable storyline, there were flat denials from WikiLeaks, which distributed the supposedly “hacked” Democratic emails, that the information came from Russia – and there was the curious inability of the National Security Agency to use its immense powers to supply any technical evidence to support the Russia-hack scenario.</p>
<p><strong>The Trump Shock</strong></p>
<p>But the shock of Trump’s election and the decision of many never-Trumpers to cast their lot with the Resistance led to a situation in which any prudent skepticism or demand for evidence was swept aside.</p>

<p>So, on Jan. 6, 2017, President Obama’s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released an evidence-free report that he said was compiled by “hand-picked” analysts from the CIA, FBI and NSA, offering an “assessment” that Russia and President Putin were behind the release of the Democratic emails in a plot to help Trump win the presidency.</p>
<p>Despite the extraordinary gravity of the charge, even New York Times correspondent Scott Shane noted that proof was lacking. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russian-hacking-election-intelligence.html?mcubz=3">wrote</a> at the time: “What is missing from the <div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

						[the Jan. 6] public report is what many Americans most eagerly anticipated: hard evidence to back up the agencies’ claims that the Russian government engineered the election attack. … Instead, the message from the agencies essentially amounts to ‘trust us.’”</p>
<p>But the “assessment” served a useful purpose for the never-Trumpers: it applied an official imprimatur on the case for delegitimizing Trump’s election and even raised the long-shot hope that the Electoral College might reverse the outcome and possibly install a compromise candidate, such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell, in the White House. Though the Powell ploy fizzled, the hope of somehow removing Trump from office continued to bubble, fueled by the growing hysteria around Russia-gate.</p>
<p>Virtually all skepticism about the evidence-free “assessment” was banned. For months, the Times and other newspapers of record repeated the lie that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies had concurred in the conclusion about the Russian “hack.” Even when that <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/06/29/nyt-finally-retracts-russia-gate-canard/">falsehood was belatedly acknowledged</a>, the major news outlets just shifted the phrasing slightly to say that U.S. intelligence agencies had reached the Russian “hack” conclusion. Shane’s blunt initial recognition about the lack of proof disappeared from the mainstream media’s approved narrative of Russia-gate.</p>
<p>Doubts about the Russian “hack” or dissident suggestions that what we were <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/05/13/the-soft-coup-of-russia-gate/">witnessing was a “soft coup”</a> were scoffed at by leading media commentators. Other warnings from veteran U.S. intelligence professionals about <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/20/more-holes-in-russia-gate-narrative/">the weaknesses of the Russia-gate</a> narrative and the danger of letting politicized intelligence overturn a constitutional election were also brushed aside in pursuit of the goal of removing Trump from the White House.</p>
<p>It didn’t even seem to matter when new <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/12/05/the-tangled-threads-of-russia-gate/">Russia-gate disclosures </a>conflicted with <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/12/05/the-tangled-threads-of-russia-gate/">the original narrative</a> that Putin had somehow set Trump up as a Manchurian candidate. All normal journalistic skepticism was jettisoned. It was as if the Russia-gate advocates started with the conclusion that Trump must go and then made the facts fit into that mold, but anyone who noted the violations of normal investigative procedures was dismissed as a “Trump enabler” or a “Moscow stooge.”</p>
<p><strong>The Text Evidence</strong></p>
<p>But then came the FBI text messages, providing documentary evivdence that key FBI officials involved in the Russia-gate investigation were indeed deeply biased and out to get Trump, adding hard proof to Trump’s longstanding lament that he was the subject of a “witch hunt<strong>.”</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Justified or not, Trump’s feeling of vindication could hardly be more dangerous — particularly at a time when the most urgent need is to drain some testosterone from the self-styled Stable-Genius-in-Chief and his martinet generals.</p>
<p>On the home front, Trump, his wealthy friends, and like-thinkers in Congress may now feel they have an even wider<em> carte blanche</em> to visit untold misery on the poor, the widow, the stranger and other vulnerable humans. That was always an underlying danger of the Resistance’s strategy to seize on whatever weapons were available – no matter how reckless or unfair – to “get Trump.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, Russia-gate has become so central to the Washington establishment’s storyline that there appears to be no room for second-thoughts or turning back. The momentum is such that some Democrats and the media never-Trumpers can’t stop stoking the smoke of Russia-gate and holding out hope against hope that it will somehow justify Trump’s impeachment.</p>
<p>Yet, the sordid process of using legal/investigative means to settle political scores further compromises the principle of the “rule of law” and integrity of journalism in the eyes of many Americans. After a year of Russia-gate, the “rule of law” and “pursuit of truth” appear to have been reduced to high-falutin’ phrases for political score-setttling, a process besmirched by Republicans in earlier pursuits of Democrats and now appearing to be a bipartisan method for punishing political rivals regardless of the lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Strzok and Page</strong></p>
<p>Peter Strzok (pronounced “struck”) has an interesting pedigree with multiple tasks regarding both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. As the FBI’s chief of counterespionage during the investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s unauthorized use of a personal email server for classified information, Strzok reportedly changed the words “grossly negligent” (which could have triggered legal prosecution) to the far less serious “extremely careless” in FBI Director James Comey’s depiction of Clinton’s actions. This semantic shift cleared the way for Comey to conclude just 20 days before the Democratic National Convention began in July 2016, that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
<p>Then, as Deputy Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division, Strzok led the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election of 2016. It is a safe bet that he took a strong hand in hand-picking the FBI contingent of analysts that joined “hand-picked” counterparts from CIA and NSA in preparing the evidence-free, Jan. 6, 2017 assessment accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of interfering in the election of 2016. (Although accepted in Establishment groupthink as revealed truth, that poor excuse for analysis reflected the apogee of intelligence politicization — rivaled only by the fraudulent intelligence on “weapons of mass destruction“ in Iraq 15 years ago.)</p>
<p>In June and July 2017 Strzok was the top FBI official working on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, but was taken off that job when the Justice Department IG learned of the Strzok-Page text-message exchange and told Mueller.</p>
<p>There is no little irony in the fact that what did in the FBI sweathearts was their visceral disdain for Mr. Trump, their cheerleading-cum-kid-gloves treatment of Mrs. Clinton and her associates, their 1950-ish, James Clapperesque attitude toward Russians as “almost genetically driven” to evil, and their (Strzok/Page) elitist conviction that they know far better what is good for the country than regular American citizens, including those “deplorables” whom Clinton said made up half of Trump’s supporters.</p>
<p>But Strzok/Page had no idea that their hubris, elitism and scheming would be revealed in so tangible a way. Worst of all for them, the very thing that Strzok, in particular, worked so hard to achieve — the sabotaging of Trump and immunization of Mrs. Clinton and her closest advisers is now coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p><strong>Congress: Oversee? or Overlook?</strong></p>
<p>At this point, the $64 question is whether the various congressional oversight committees will remain ensconced in their customarily cozy role as “overlook” committees, or whether they will have the courage to attempt to carry out their Constitutional duty. The latter course would mean confronting a powerful Deep State and its large toolbox of well-practiced retaliatory techniques, including J. Edgar Hoover-style blackmail on steroids, enabled by electronic surveillance of just about everything and everyone. Yes, today’s technology permits blanket collection, and “Collect Everything” has become the motto.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">
</div>
<p>Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, with almost four decades of membership in the House and Senate, openly warned incoming President Trump in January 2017 against criticizing the U.S. intelligence community because U.S. intelligence officials have “six ways from Sunday to get back at you” if you are “dumb” enough to take them on.</p>
<p>Thanks to the almost 10,000 text messages between Strzok and Page, only a small fraction of which were given to Congress four weeks ago, there is now real evidentiary meat on the bones of the suspicions that there indeed was a “deep-state coup” to “correct” the outcome of the 2016 election. We now know that the supposedly apolitical FBI officials had huge political axes to grind. The Strzok-Page exchanges drip with disdain for Trump and those deemed his smelly deplorable supporters. In one text message, Strzok expressed visceral contempt for those working-class Trump voters, writing on Aug. 26, 2016, “Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support. … it’s scary real down here.”</p>
<p>The texts even show Strzok warning of the need for an “insurance policy” to thwart Trump on the off-chance that his poll numbers closed in on those of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
<p>An Aug. 6, 2016 text message, for example, shows Page giving her knight in shining armor strong affirmation: “Maybe you’re meant to stay where you are because you’re meant to protect the country from that menace [Trump].” That text to Strzok includes a link to a David Brooks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/trumps-enablers-will-finally-have-to-take-a-stand.html">column</a> in The New York Times, in which Brooks concludes with the clarion call: “There comes a time when neutrality and laying low become dishonorable. If you’re not in revolt, you’re in cahoots. When this period and your name are mentioned, decades hence, your grandkids will look away in shame.”</p>
<p>Another text message shows that other senior government officials – alarmed at the possibility of a Trump presidency – joined the discussion. In an apparent reference to an August 2016 meeting with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Strzok wrote to Page on Aug. 15, 2016, “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he [Trump] gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.”  Strzok added, “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you’re 40.”</p>
<p><strong>Insurance Policy?</strong></p>
<p>Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, says he will ask Strzok to explain the “insurance policy” when he calls him to testify. What seems already clear is that the celebrated “Steele Dossier” was part of the “insurance,” as was the evidence-less legend that <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/24/intel-vets-challenge-russia-hack-evidence/">Russia hacked</a> the DNC’s and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails and <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/20/more-holes-in-russia-gate-narrative/">gave them to WikiLeaks</a>.<a class="image-anchor" href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1392" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal-291x300.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" srcset="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal-291x300.jpg 291w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal.jpg 350w" alt="" width="291" height="300" data-lazy-loaded="true" /></a></p>
<p>If congressional investigators have been paying attention, they already know what former weapons inspector Scott Ritter shared with Veteran intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) colleagues this week; namely, that Fusion GPS’s Glenn Simpson, who commissioned the Russia dossier using Democratic Party money, said he reached out to Steele after June 17, just three days before Steele’s <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/03/29/the-sleazy-origins-of-russia-gate/">first report was published</a>, drawing on seven sources.</p>
<p>“There is a snowball’s chance in hell that this is raw intelligence gathered by Steele; rather he seems to have drawn on a single ‘trusted intermediary’ to gather unsubstantiated rumor already in existence.”</p>
<p>Another VIPS colleague, Phil Giraldi, writing out of his own experience in private sector consulting, added: “The fact that you do not control your sources frequently means that they will feed you what they think you want to hear. Since they are only doing it for money, the more lurid the details the better, as it increases the apparent value of the information. The private security firm in turn, which is also doing it for the money, will pass on the stories and even embroider them to keep the client happy and to encourage him to come back for more. When I read the Steele dossier it looked awfully familiar to me, like the scores of similar reports I had seen which combined bullshit with enough credible information to make the whole product look respectable.”</p>
<p>It is now widely known that the Democrats ponied up the “insurance premiums,” so to speak, for former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele’s “dossier” of lurid — but largely unproven — “intelligence” on Trump and the Russians. If, as many have concluded, the <strong> </strong> dossier was used to help justify a FISA warrant to snoop on the Trump campaign, those involved will be in deep kimchi, if congressional overseers do their job.</p>
<p>How, you might ask, could Strzok and associates undertake these extra-legal steps with such blithe disregard for the possible consequences should they be caught? The answer is easy; Mrs. Clinton was a shoo-in, remember? This was just extra insurance with no expectation of any “death benefit” ever coming into play — save for Trump’s electoral demise in November 2016. The attitude seemed to be that, if abuse of the FISA law should eventually be discovered — there would be little interest in a serious investigation by the editors of The New York Times and other anti-Trump publications and whatever troubles remained could be handled by President Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee of Judiciary on Crime and Terrorism, joined Sen. Grassley in signing the letter referring Christopher Steele to the Justice Department to investigate what appear to be false statements about the dossier. In signing, Graham noted the “many stop signs the Department of Justice ignored in its use of the dossier.” The signature of committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, however, was missing — an early sign that a highly partisan battle royale is in the offing.  On Tuesday, Feinstein unilaterally released a voluminous transcript of Glenn Simpson’s earlier testimony and, as though on cue, Establishment pundits portrayed Steele as a good source and Fusion GPS’s Glenn Simpson as a victim.</p>
<p>The Donnybrook is now underway; the outcome uncertain.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcapslede">American politics</span> have rarely presented a more disheartening spectacle. The repellent and dangerous antics of Donald Trump are troubling enough, but so is the Democratic Party leadership’s failure to take in the significance of the 2016 election campaign. Bernie Sanders’s challenge to Hillary Clinton, combined with Trump’s triumph, revealed the breadth of popular anger at politics as usual – the blend of neoliberal domestic policy and interventionist foreign policy that constitutes consensus in Washington. Neoliberals celebrate market utility as the sole criterion of worth; interventionists exalt military adventure abroad as a means of fighting evil in order to secure global progress. Both agendas have proved calamitous for most Americans. Many registered their disaffection in 2016. Sanders is a social democrat and Trump a demagogic mountebank, but their campaigns underscored a widespread repudiation of the Washington consensus. For about a week after the election, pundits discussed the possibility of a more capacious Democratic strategy. It appeared that the party might learn something from Clinton’s defeat. Then everything changed.</p>
<div id="article-body" class=" mpu">
<p>A story that had circulated during the campaign without much effect resurfaced: it involved the charge that Russian operatives had hacked into the servers of the Democratic National Committee, revealing embarrassing emails that damaged Clinton’s chances. With stunning speed, a new centrist-liberal orthodoxy came into being, enveloping the major media and the bipartisan Washington establishment. This secular religion has attracted hordes of converts in the first year of the Trump presidency. In its capacity to exclude dissent, it is like no other formation of mass opinion in my adult life, though it recalls a few dim childhood memories of anti-communist hysteria during the early 1950s.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the faith, based on the hacking charge, is the belief that Vladimir Putin orchestrated an attack on American democracy by ordering his minions to interfere in the election on behalf of Trump. The story became gospel with breathtaking suddenness and completeness. Doubters are perceived as heretics and as apologists for Trump and Putin, the evil twins and co-conspirators behind this attack on American democracy. Responsibility for the absence of debate lies in large part with the major media outlets. Their uncritical embrace and endless repetition of the Russian hack story have made it seem a fait accompli in the public mind. It is hard to estimate popular belief in this new orthodoxy, but it does not seem to be merely a creed of Washington insiders. If you question the received narrative in casual conversations, you run the risk of provoking blank stares or overt hostility – even from old friends. This has all been baffling and troubling to me; there have been moments when pop-culture fantasies (body snatchers, Kool-Aid) have come to mind.</p>
<p>Like any orthodoxy worth its salt, the religion of the Russian hack depends not on evidence but on ex cathedra pronouncements on the part of authoritative institutions and their overlords. Its scriptural foundation is a confused and largely fact-free ‘assessment’ produced last January by a small number of ‘hand-picked’ analysts – as James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, described them – from the CIA, the FBI and the NSA. The claims of the last were made with only ‘moderate’ confidence. The label Intelligence Community Assessment creates a misleading impression of unanimity, given that only three of the 16 US intelligence agencies contributed to the report. And indeed the assessment itself contained this crucial admission: ‘Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation and precedents.’ Yet the assessment has passed into the media imagination as if it were unassailable fact, allowing journalists to assume what has yet to be proved. In doing so they serve as mouthpieces for the intelligence agencies, or at least for those ‘hand-picked’ analysts.</p>
<p>It is not the first time the intelligence agencies have played this role. When I hear the Intelligence Community Assessment cited as a reliable source, I always recall the part played by the <em>New York Times</em> in legitimating CIA reports of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s putative weapons of mass destruction, not to mention the long history of disinformation (a.k.a. ‘fake news’) as a tactic for advancing one administration or another’s political agenda. Once again, the established press is legitimating pronouncements made by the Church Fathers of the national security state. Clapper is among the most vigorous of these. He perjured himself before Congress in 2013, when he denied that the NSA had ‘wittingly’ spied on Americans – a lie for which he has never been held to account. In May 2017, he told NBC’s Chuck Todd that the Russians were highly likely to have colluded with Trump’s campaign because they are ‘almost genetically driven to co-opt, penetrate, gain favour, whatever, which is a typical Russian technique’. The current orthodoxy exempts the Church Fathers from standards imposed on ordinary people, and condemns Russians – above all Putin – as uniquely, ‘almost genetically’ diabolical.</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to understand how the Democratic Party, which once felt scepticism towards the intelligence agencies, can now embrace the CIA and the FBI as sources of incontrovertible truth. One possible explanation is that Trump’s election has created a permanent emergency in the liberal imagination, based on the belief that the threat he poses is unique and unprecedented. It’s true that Trump’s menace is viscerally real. But the menace posed by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was equally real. The damage done by Bush and Cheney – who ravaged the Middle East, legitimated torture and expanded unconstitutional executive power – was truly unprecedented, and probably permanent. Trump does pose an unprecedented threat to undocumented immigrants and Muslim travellers, whose protection is urgent and necessary. But on most issues he is a standard issue Republican. He is perfectly at home with Paul Ryan’s austerity agenda, which involves enormous transfers of wealth to the most privileged Americans. He is as committed as any other Republican to repealing Obama’s Affordable Care Act. During the campaign he posed as an apostate on free trade and an opponent of overseas military intervention, but now that he is in office his free trade views are shifting unpredictably and his foreign policy team is composed of generals with impeccable interventionist credentials.</p>
<p>Trump is committed to continuing his predecessors’ lavish funding of the already bloated Defence Department, and his Fortress America is a blustering, undisciplined version of Madeleine Albright’s ‘indispensable nation’. Both Trump and Albright assume that the United States should be able to do as it pleases in the international arena: Trump because it’s the greatest country in the world, Albright because it’s an exceptional force for global good. Nor is there anything unprecedented about Trump’s desire for détente with Russia, which until at least 2012 was the official position of the Democratic Party. What is unprecedented about Trump is his offensive style: contemptuous, bullying, inarticulate, and yet perfectly pitched to appeal to the anger and anxiety of his target audience. His excess has licensed overt racism and proud misogyny among some of his supporters. This is cause for denunciation, but I am less persuaded that it justifies the anti-Russian mania.</p>
<p>Besides Trump’s supposed uniqueness, there are two other assumptions behind the furore in Washington: the first is that the Russian hack unquestionably occurred, and the second is that the Russians are our implacable enemies. The second provides the emotional charge for the first. Both seem to me problematic. With respect to the first, the hacking charges are unproved and may well remain so. Edward Snowden and others familiar with the NSA say that if long-distance hacking had taken place the agency would have monitored it and could detail its existence without compromising their secret sources and methods. In September, Snowden told <em>Der Spiegel</em> that the NSA ‘probably knows quite well who the invaders were’. And yet ‘it has not presented any evidence, although I suspect it exists. The question is: why not? … I suspect it discovered other attackers in the systems, maybe there were six or seven groups at work.’ The NSA’s capacity to follow hacking to its source is a matter of public record. When the agency investigated pervasive and successful Chinese hacking into US military and defence industry installations, it was able to trace the hacks to the building where they originated, a People’s Liberation Army facility in Shanghai. That information was published in the <em>New York Times</em> but, this time, the NSA’s failure to provide evidence has gone curiously unremarked. When <em>The Intercept</em> published a story about the NSA’s alleged discovery that Russian military intelligence had attempted to hack into US state and local election systems, the agency’s undocumented assertions about the Russian origins of the hack were allowed to stand as unchallenged fact and quickly became treated as such in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there has been a blizzard of ancillary accusations, including much broader and vaguer charges of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. It remains possible that Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who has been appointed to investigate these allegations, may turn up some compelling evidence of contacts between Trump’s people and various Russians. It would be surprising if an experienced prosecutor empowered to cast a dragnet came up empty-handed, and the arrests have already begun. But what is striking about them is that the charges have nothing to do with Russian interference in the election. There has been much talk about the possibility that the accused may provide damaging evidence against Trump in exchange for lighter sentences, but this is merely speculation. Paul Manafort, at one point Trump’s campaign manager, has pleaded not guilty to charges of failing to register his public relations firm as a foreign agent for the Ukrainian government and concealing his millions of dollars in fees. But all this occurred before the 2016 campaign. George Papadopolous, a foreign policy adviser, has pleaded guilty to the charge of lying to the FBI about his bungling efforts to arrange a meeting between Trump’s people and the Russian government – an opportunity the Trump campaign declined. Mueller’s most recent arrestee, Michael Flynn, the unhinged Islamophobe who was briefly Trump’s national security adviser, has pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador in December – weeks after the election. This is the sort of backchannel diplomacy that routinely occurs during the interim between one administration and the next. It is not a sign of collusion.</p>
<p>So far, after months of ‘bombshells’ that turn out to be duds, there is still no actual evidence for the claim that the Kremlin ordered interference in the American election. Meanwhile serious doubts have surfaced about the technical basis for the hacking claims. Independent observers have argued it is more likely that the emails were leaked from inside, not hacked from outside. On this front, the most persuasive case was made by a group called Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, former employees of the US intelligence agencies who distinguished themselves in 2003 by debunking Colin Powell’s claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, hours after Powell had presented his pseudo-evidence at the UN. (There are members of VIPS who dissent from the VIPS report’s conclusions, but their arguments are in turn contested by the authors of the report.) The VIPS findings received no attention in major media outlets, except Fox News – which from the centre-left perspective is worse than no attention at all. Mainstream media have dismissed the VIPS report as a conspiracy theory (apparently the Russian hacking story does not count as one). The crucial issue here and elsewhere is the exclusion from public discussion of <em>any</em> critical perspectives on the orthodox narrative, even the perspectives of people with professional credentials and a solid track record.</p>
<p>Both the DNC hacking story and the one involving the emails of John Podesta, a Clinton campaign operative, involve a shadowy bunch of putatively Russian hackers called Fancy Bear – also known among the technically inclined as APT28. The name Fancy Bear was introduced by Dimitri Alperovitch, the chief technology officer of Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC to investigate the theft of their emails. Alperovitch is also a fellow at the Atlantic Council, an anti-Russian Washington think tank. In its report Crowdstrike puts forward close to zero evidence for its claim that those responsible were Russian, let alone for its assertion that they were affiliated with Russian military intelligence. And yet, from this point on, the assumption that this was a Russian cyber operation was unquestioned. When the FBI arrived on the scene, the Bureau either did not request or was refused access to the DNC servers; instead it depended entirely on the Crowdstrike analysis. Crowdstrike, meanwhile, was being forced to retract another claim, that the Russians had successfully hacked the guidance systems of the Ukrainian artillery. The Ukrainian military and the British International Institute for Strategic Studies both contradicted this claim, and Crowdstrike backed down. But its DNC analysis was allowed to stand and even become the basis for the January Intelligence Community Assessment.</p>
<p>The chatter surrounding the hack would never have acquired such urgency were it not for the accompanying assumption: Russia is a uniquely dangerous adversary, with which we should avoid all contact. Without that belief, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s meetings with Russians in September 2016 would become routine discussions between a senator and foreign officials. Flynn’s post-election conversations with the Russian ambassador would appear unremarkable. Trump’s cronies’ attempts to do business in Russia would become merely sleazy. Donald Trump Jr’s meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya would be transformed from a melodrama of shady intrigue to a comedy of errors – with the candidate’s son expecting to receive information to use against Clinton but discovering Veselnitskaya only wanted to talk about repealing sanctions and restarting the flow of Russian orphans to the United States. And Putin himself would become just another autocrat, with whom democracies could engage without endorsing.</p>
<p>Sceptical voices, such as those of the VIPS, have been drowned out by a din of disinformation. Flagrantly false stories, like the <em>Washington Post</em> report that the Russians had hacked into the Vermont electrical grid, are published, then retracted 24 hours later. Sometimes – like the stories about Russian interference in the French and German elections – they are not retracted even after they have been discredited. These stories have been thoroughly debunked by French and German intelligence services but continue to hover, poisoning the atmosphere, confusing debate. The claim that the Russians hacked local and state voting systems in the US was refuted by California and Wisconsin election officials, but their comments generated a mere whisper compared with the uproar created by the original story. The rush to publish without sufficient attention to accuracy has become the new normal in journalism. Retraction or correction is almost beside the point: the false accusation has done its work.</p>
<p class="secast">*</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcapslede">The consequence</span> is a spreading confusion that envelops everything. Epistemological nihilism looms, but some people and institutions have more power than others to define what constitutes an agreed-on reality. To say this is to risk dismissal as the ultimate wing-nut in the lexicon of contemporary Washington: the conspiracy theorist. Still, the fact remains: sometimes powerful people arrange to promote ideas that benefit their common interests. Whether we call this hegemony, conspiracy or merely special privilege hardly matters. What does matter is the power to create what Gramsci called the ‘common sense’ of an entire society. Even if much of that society is indifferent to or suspicious of the official common sense, it still becomes embedded among the tacit assumptions that set the boundaries of ‘responsible opinion’. So the Democratic establishment (along with a few Republicans) and the major media outlets have made ‘Russian meddling’ the common sense of the current moment. What kind of cultural work does this common sense do? What are the consequences of the spectacle the media call (with characteristic originality) ‘Russiagate’?</p>
<p>The most immediate consequence is that, by finding foreign demons who can be blamed for Trump’s ascendancy, the Democratic leadership have shifted the blame for their defeat away from their own policies without questioning any of their core assumptions. Amid the general recoil from Trump, they can even style themselves dissenters – ‘#the resistance’ was the label Clintonites appropriated within a few days of the election. Mainstream Democrats have begun to use the word ‘progressive’ to apply to a platform that amounts to little more than preserving Obamacare, gesturing towards greater income equality and protecting minorities. This agenda is timid. It has nothing to say about challenging the influence of concentrated capital on policy, reducing the inflated defence budget or withdrawing from overextended foreign commitments; yet without those initiatives, even the mildest egalitarian policies face insuperable obstacles. More genuine insurgencies are in the making, which confront corporate power and connect domestic with foreign policy, but they face an uphill battle against the entrenched money and power of the Democratic leadership – the likes of Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, the Clintons and the DNC. Russiagate offers Democratic elites a way to promote party unity against Trump-Putin, while the DNC purges Sanders’s supporters.</p>
<p>For the DNC, the great value of the Russian hack story is that it focuses attention away from what was actually in their emails. The documents revealed a deeply corrupt organisation, whose pose of impartiality was a sham. Even the reliably pro-Clinton <em>Washington Post</em> has admitted that ‘many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign.’ Further evidence of collusion between the Clinton machine and the DNC surfaced recently in a memoir by Donna Brazile, who became interim chair of the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in the wake of the email revelations. Brazile describes discovering an agreement dated 26 August 2015, which specified (she writes)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="leftranged">that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics and mailings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="leftranged">Before the primaries had even begun, the supposedly neutral DNC – which had been close to insolvency – had been bought by the Clinton campaign.</p>
<p>Another recent revelation of DNC tactics concerns the origins of the inquiry into Trump’s supposed links to Putin. The story began in April 2016, when the DNC hired a Washington research firm called Fusion GPS to unearth any connections between Trump and Russia. The assignment involved the payment of ‘cash for trash’, as the Clinton campaign liked to say. Fusion GPS eventually produced the trash, a lurid account written by the former British MI6 intelligence agent Christopher Steele, based on hearsay purchased from anonymous Russian sources. Amid prostitutes and golden showers, a story emerged: the Russian government had been blackmailing and bribing Donald Trump for years, on the assumption that he would become president some day and serve the Kremlin’s interests. In this fantastic tale, Putin becomes a preternaturally prescient schemer. Like other accusations of collusion, this one has become vaguer over time, adding to the murky atmosphere without ever providing any evidence. The Clinton campaign tried to persuade established media outlets to publicise the Steele dossier, but with uncharacteristic circumspection, they declined to promote what was plainly political trash rather than reliable reporting. Yet the FBI apparently took the Steele dossier seriously enough to include a summary of it in a secret appendix to the Intelligence Community Assessment. Two weeks before the inauguration, James Comey, the director of the FBI, described the dossier to Trump. After Comey’s briefing was leaked to the press, the website Buzzfeed published the dossier in full, producing hilarity and hysteria in the Washington establishment.</p>
<p>The Steele dossier inhabits a shadowy realm where ideology and intelligence, disinformation and revelation overlap. It is the antechamber to the wider system of epistemological nihilism created by various rival factions in the intelligence community: the ‘tree of smoke’ that, for the novelist Denis Johnson, symbolised CIA operations in Vietnam. I inhaled that smoke myself in 1969-70, when I was a cryptographer with a Top Secret clearance on a US navy ship that carried missiles armed with nuclear warheads – the existence of which the navy denied. I was stripped of my clearance and later honourably discharged when I refused to join the Sealed Authenticator System, which would have authorised the launch of those allegedly non-existent nuclear weapons. The tree of smoke has only grown more complex and elusive since then. Yet the Democratic Party has now embarked on a full-scale rehabilitation of the intelligence community – or at least the part of it that supports the notion of Russian hacking. (We can be sure there is disagreement behind the scenes.) And it is not only the Democratic establishment that is embracing the deep state. Some of the party’s base, believing Trump and Putin to be joined at the hip, has taken to ranting about ‘treason’ like a reconstituted John Birch Society.</p>
<p>I thought of these ironies when I visited the Tate Modern exhibition <em>Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power</em>, which featured the work of black American artists from the 1960s and 1970s, when intelligence agencies (and agents provocateurs) were spearheading a government crackdown on black militants, draft resisters, deserters and antiwar activists. Amid the paintings, collages and assemblages there was a single Confederate flag, accompanied by grim reminders of the Jim Crow past – a Klansman in full regalia, a black body dangling from a tree. There were also at least half a dozen US flags, juxtaposed in whole or in part with images of contemporary racial oppression that could have occurred anywhere in America: dead black men carted off on stretchers by skeletons in police uniform; a black prisoner tied to a chair, awaiting torture. The point was to contrast the pretensions of ‘the land of the free’ with the practices of the national security state and local police forces. The black artists of that era knew their enemy: black people were not being killed and imprisoned by some nebulous foreign adversary, but by the FBI, the CIA and the police.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has now developed a new outlook on the world, a more ambitious partnership between liberal humanitarian interventionists and neoconservative militarists than existed under the cautious Obama. This may be the most disastrous consequence for the Democratic Party of the new anti-Russian orthodoxy: the loss of the opportunity to formulate a more humane and coherent foreign policy. The obsession with Putin has erased any possibility of complexity from the Democratic world picture, creating a void quickly filled by the monochrome fantasies of Hillary Clinton and her exceptionalist allies. For people like Max Boot and Robert Kagan, war is a desirable state of affairs, especially when viewed from the comfort of their keyboards, and the rest of the world – apart from a few bad guys – is filled with populations who want to build societies just like ours: pluralistic, democratic and open for business. This view is difficult to challenge when it cloaks itself in humanitarian sentiment. There is horrific suffering in the world; the US has abundant resources to help relieve it; the moral imperative is clear. There are endless forms of international engagement that do not involve military intervention. But it is the path taken by US policy often enough that one may suspect humanitarian rhetoric is nothing more than window-dressing for a more mundane geopolitics – one that defines the national interest as global and virtually limitless.</p>
<p>Having come of age during the Vietnam War, a calamitous consequence of that inflated definition of national interest, I have always been attracted to the realist critique of globalism. Realism is a label forever besmirched by association with Henry Kissinger, who used it as a rationale for intervening covertly and overtly in other nations’ affairs. Yet there is a more humane realist tradition, the tradition of George Kennan and William Fulbright, which emphasises the limits of military might, counselling that great power requires great restraint. This tradition challenges the doctrine of regime change under the guise of democracy promotion, which – despite its abysmal failures in Iraq and Libya – retains a baffling legitimacy in official Washington. Russiagate has extended its shelf life.</p>
<p class="secast">*</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcapslede">We can gauge</span> the corrosive impact of the Democrats’ fixation on Russia by asking what they aren’t talking about when they talk about Russian hacking. For a start, they aren’t talking about interference of other sorts in the election, such as the Republican Party’s many means of disenfranchising minority voters. Nor are they talking about the trillion dollar defence budget that pre-empts the possibility of single-payer healthcare and other urgently needed social programmes; nor about the modernisation of the American nuclear arsenal which Obama began and Trump plans to accelerate, and which raises the risk of the ultimate environmental calamity, nuclear war – a threat made more serious than it has been in decades by America’s combative stance towards Russia. The prospect of impeaching Trump and removing him from office by convicting him of collusion with Russia has created an atmosphere of almost giddy anticipation among leading Democrats, allowing them to forget that the rest of the Republican Party is composed of many politicians far more skilful in Washington’s ways than their president will ever be.</p>
<p>It is not the Democratic Party that is leading the search for alternatives to the wreckage created by Republican policies: a tax plan that will soak the poor and middle class to benefit the rich; a heedless pursuit of fossil fuels that is already resulting in the contamination of the water supply of the Dakota people; and continued support for police policies of militarisation and mass incarceration. It is local populations that are threatened by oil spills and police beatings, and that is where humane populism survives. A multitude of insurgent groups have begun to use the outrage against Trump as a lever to move the party in egalitarian directions: Justice Democrats, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America, as well as a host of local and regional organisations. They recognise that there are far more urgent – and genuine – reasons to oppose Trump than vague allegations of collusion with Russia. They are posing an overdue challenge to the long con of neoliberalism, and the technocratic arrogance that led to Clinton’s defeat in Rust Belt states. Recognising that the current leadership will not bring about significant change, they are seeking funding from outside the DNC. This is the real resistance, as opposed to ‘#theresistance’.</p>
<p>On certain important issues – such as broadening support for single-payer healthcare, promoting a higher minimum wage or protecting undocumented immigrants from the most flagrant forms of exploitation – these insurgents are winning wide support. Candidates like Paula Jean Swearengin, a coal miner’s daughter from West Virginia who is running in the Democratic primary for nomination to the US Senate, are challenging establishment Democrats who stand cheek by jowl with Republicans in their service to concentrated capital. Swearengin’s opponent is Joe Manchin, whom the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has compared to Doug Jones, another ‘very conservative’ Democrat who recently won election to the US Senate in Alabama, narrowly defeating a Republican disgraced by accusations of sexual misconduct with 14-year-old girls. I can feel relieved at that result without joining in the collective Democratic ecstasy, which reveals the party’s persistent commitment to politics as usual. Democrat leaders have persuaded themselves (and much of their base) that all the republic needs is a restoration of the status quo ante Trump. They remain oblivious to popular impatience with familiar formulas. Jess King – a Mennonite woman, Bard College MBA and founder of a local non-profit who is running for Congress as a Justice Democrat in Lancaster, Pennsylvania – put it this way: ‘We see a changing political landscape right now that isn’t measured by traditional left to right politics anymore, but bottom to top. In Pennsylvania and many other places around the country we see a grassroots economic populism on the rise, pushing against the political establishment and status quo that have failed so many in our country.’</p>
<p>Democratic insurgents are also developing a populist critique of the imperial hubris that has sponsored multiple failed crusades, extorted disproportionate sacrifice from the working class and provoked support for Trump, who presented himself (however misleadingly) as an opponent of open-ended interventionism. On foreign policy, the insurgents face an even more entrenched opposition than on domestic policy: a bipartisan consensus aflame with outrage at the threat to democracy supposedly posed by Russian hacking. Still, they may have found a tactical way forward, by focusing on the unequal burden borne by the poor and working class in the promotion and maintenance of American empire.</p>
<p>This approach animates <em>Autopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisis,</em> a 33-page document whose authors include Norman Solomon, founder of the web-based insurgent lobby RootsAction.org. ‘The Democratic Party’s claims of fighting for “working families” have been undermined by its refusal to directly challenge corporate power, enabling Trump to masquerade as a champion of the people,’ <em>Autopsy</em> announces. But what sets this apart from most progressive critiques is the cogent connection it makes between domestic class politics and foreign policy. For those in the Rust Belt, military service has often seemed the only escape from the shambles created by neoliberal policies; yet the price of escape has been high. As <em>Autopsy</em> notes, ‘the wisdom of continual war’ – what Clinton calls ‘global leadership’ –</p>

<p class="leftranged">Francis Shen of the University of Minnesota and Douglas Kriner of Boston University analysed election results in three key states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – and found that ‘even controlling in a statistical model for many other alternative explanations, we find that there is a significant and meaningful relationship between a community’s rate of military sacrifice and its support for Trump.’ Clinton’s record of uncritical commitment to military intervention allowed Trump to have it both ways, playing to jingoist resentment while posing as an opponent of protracted and pointless war. Kriner and Shen conclude that Democrats may want to ‘re-examine their foreign policy posture if they hope to erase Trump’s electoral gains among constituencies exhausted and alienated by 15 years of war’. If the insurgent movements within the Democratic Party begin to formulate an intelligent foreign policy critique, a re-examination may finally occur. And the world may come into sharper focus as a place where American power, like American virtue, is limited. For this Democrat, that is an outcome devoutly to be wished. It’s a long shot, but there is something happening out there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Stigler Center working paper looks into the effects of referendums and public initiatives on public policy and finds that direct democracy better represents the will of the majority, and therefore might also be better able to counteract the power of special interests over policymaking.</p>
<p>The rise of anti-establishment populist movements in the U.S. and Europe is one of the most remarkable political developments of the last few years. Within the span of a few months in 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union and Americans elected Donald Trump as president, two outcomes that shocked intellectual and political elites.</p>
<p>The global populist rebellion seems to have slowed down a notch in recent months, as far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders lost elections in France and in the Netherlands, respectively, but the ascent of populist politics nevertheless revealed the extent of voters’ discontent with the status quo and led some scholars to refer to it as a symptom of a crisis of Western liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Much of this has to do with the outsized influence of special interests. In the U.S., the widespread sense that the economic and political systems are “rigged” was a major contributor to the rise of Trump, who repeatedly lambasted the influence of special interests on American politics and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>But long before Trump, Americans were already losing trust in democratic institutions. According to a Gallup poll from June of last year, Americans’ confidence in institutions is near historical lows at 32 percent, with Congress’s approval rating at an abysmal 9 percent. In a conversation with Stigler Center Director Luigi Zingales in March, Judge Richard Posner described members of Congress as “slave<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box hundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"  style='background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;'><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row "><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1 fusion-builder-column-7 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last fusion-column-no-min-height 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;'>

						[s] to the donors” and said that “[T]he real corruption is the ownership of Congress by the rich.” In a recent interview with ProMarket, Stanford professor Anat Admati listed “political engagement by corporations, including lobbying, campaign contributions, and other tactics that can create confusion and cause policymakers to yield to narrow interests,” as one of the major contributors to public discontent, along with the failure of governments to address inequality and concentration.</p>
<p>As scholars, politicians, and thinkers seek ways to restore public trust, a new Stigler Center working paper points to a possible remedy: more direct democracy.</p>
<p>The paper, written by John G. Matsusaka of the University of Southern California, surveys the extensive literature regarding the effects of referendums and public initiatives on public policy and draws two main conclusions: 1. Contrary to the persistent notion that referendums and other forms of direct democracy lead to chaos, voters actually tend to make reasonable, even conservative choices, especially when it comes to issues like government spending or borrowing; 2. Direct democracy better represents the will of the majority and therefore might also be better able to counteract the power of special interests over policymaking.</p>
<h3>How does direct democracy affect policymaking?</h3>
<p>Direct democracy, as a form of government in which citizens are directly involved in lawmaking instead of delegating it to representatives, goes back at least to ancient Greece. In America, policy decisions were made through town hall meetings since before the founding of the republic, and in Switzerland it has been an essential part of political life since the mid-nineteenth century. In his paper, Matsusaka focuses on the U.S. and Switzerland—the two countries in which direct democracy is most active—and on two forms of direct democracy: referendums, in which citizens vote on policies proposed by government officials; and initiatives, where citizens vote on policies proposed by citizens.</p>
<p>Referendums can be divided into three types: mandatory (a government proposal is required by law to be the subject of a referendum before it goes into effect), petition referendum (a vote on a government proposal that is the result of a citizen petition), and advisory (a referendum that is called at the request of the government, and whose results are not binding in a formal sense, e.g. Brexit). An initiative is a vote that also relies on petitions, but in which citizens vote on policies proposed by the citizens themselves.</p>
<p>In recent years, as governments around the world have struggled with claims that they are overly influenced by special interests, referendums and initiatives have become increasingly popular. Between 2000 and 2010, 298 national referendums were held across the world, with 44 of those taking place in the U.S. and 167 in Europe. All but one of the 50 U.S. states have some form of direct democracy, notes Matsusaka: 30 states require voter approval on debt issues, 49 states require voter approval on constitutional amendments, 23 states allow petition referendums, and 24 states allow initiatives. In November 2016 alone, more than 150 measures appeared in 35 states, as citizens were asked to vote on policies regarding medical marijuana, gun control, health care, minimum wage, and others.</p>
<p>In attempting to estimate the effect of initiatives and referendums on public policy, Matsusaka reviewed numerous theoretical and empirical studies on the connection between initiatives and referendums and policy outcomes. Often, he notes, there is a tendency to describe the findings in the literature as “mixed” or “conflicting” (a characterization he somewhat disagrees with)—and yet, he notes, “some conclusions have been replicated so consistently that it seems safe to treat them as robust patterns.”</p>
<p>One of those patterns is that when voting on specific policies, whether fiscal or social, voters tend to be more conservative than their elected representatives. The evidence, notes Matsusaka, shows that mandatory referendums on new borrowing or spending result in significantly lower levels of both—8 percent lower spending, according to median estimates. “If voter approval is required for spending or debt increases, it is likely that spending and debt will be lower on average,” he writes.</p>
<p>This, he notes, suggests that representative governments tend to spend and borrow more than voters prefer, although he points out that this applies only to recent decades. In the early twentieth century, he writes, the opposite was the case.</p>
<p>The finding that referendums and initiatives tend to lead to more measured fiscal policies is important, because despite its increasing popularity, some still question the viability of direct democracy, arguing that voters are too uninformed, emotional, and susceptible to make decisions regarding specific policies, and that policymaking should remain exclusively in the hands of experts. In the case of Brexit, for instance, the decision by British voters to leave the EU was followed by an instant, widespread rebuke of “irrational,” “ignorant” voters who chose to ignore expert opinions for emotional reasons, to their own detriment.</p>
<p>Another curious finding is that while initiative American states and Swiss cantons have supported lower spending in the last 50 years, initiatives have also driven up spending in cities. This, Matsusaka argues, indicates that officials at the state (and canton) level tend to spend more than voters would like, whereas on the local level politicians tend to spend less than voters would like.</p>
<p>“Sometimes people criticize direct democracy and say that it would lead to anarchy and chaos. The evidence shows that that it absolutely doesn’t do that. There are different outcomes, and you might not like the outcomes, but they’re all reasonable possibilities,” says Matsusaka, the Charles F. Sexton Chair in American Enterprise in the the Marshall School of Business, Gould School of Law, and Department of Political Science at USC. “If people have to approve debt issues, we tend to see less debt issued overall—it’s not like people are irrational and borrow like crazy or entirely choke off borrowing. They are reasonable.”</p>
<h3>Can direct democracy be used to fix democracy?</h3>
<p>Another pattern that Matsusaka identifies is that direct democracy leads to more policies that reflect the views of the majority of the population. The question of whether direct democracy makes policy more congruent with citizen preferences, explains Matsusaka, is central to the literature on the subject, with the debate often divided between two opposing views. On the one hand, there is the “progressive” view, which argues that referendums and initiatives make democracy more responsive to the will of the people. On the other hand, there is the “special interest” view, which argues that direct democracy enhances the influences of special interests, because they have the resources and incentives to dominate elections and ballot measures.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of this debate, he notes, convincing evidence is limited. The existing evidence, however, finds that direct democracy states are indeed more likely to adopt policies favored by a majority of citizens. He quotes from his own 2010 study, which found that in direct democracy states, congruence with majority opinion was 18-19 percent higher than in states without direct democracy. This, he says, is consistent with the view that initiatives allow citizens to counteract the influence of special interests on policies.</p>
<p>Direct democracy, he adds, might be better equipped to withstand the influence of special interests. “You might be able buy legislators, you can give them deals or make arrangements with them. But you can’t make arrangements with 10 or 20 million voters. The most you can do is pour a lot of money into running commercials and try to persuade them, but you can’t corrupt them.You can try to trick and deceive them, but there are limits to how far that can go. If you look at big businesses, most of them don’t like direct democracy. They’d much rather be able work things out with legislators.”</p>
<p>The paper, he says, shows that direct democracy “leads to more majoritarian outcomes. My own personal view is that in a democracy, that’s a good thing. Not in every single case, but in most cases it’s a good thing.”</p>
<p>This, he acknowledges, presents some normative questions which the relevant literature has hardly confronted so far. Democracies often have safeguards in place to limit the ability of the majority to enact certain policies, for instance policies that might discriminate against or otherwise harm minority groups. Initiatives and referendums, he notes, might achieve majoritarian outcomes by overriding these safeguards. “It’s important to keep some the safeguards, like vigilant courts, in place to protect minority rights,” Matsusaka adds.</p>
<p>Despite the criticisms by political elites, however, Matsusaka argues that among voters direct democracy is “tremendously popular.” “There are a lot of surveys in which ordinary citizens were asked who they trust to make decisions, and those surveys routinely show that ordinary citizens trust the people over politicians by a 3-to-1 ratio. It’s always been unpopular with the elites, in my opinion partly because it takes away from their power. But arguments that are made against direct democracy, for instance that people are not informed enough or that turnout is low, are also true when people go to vote for their elected officials. These are really arguments against democracy itself, not direct democracy.”</p>
<p>This week, Matsusaka will visit the Stigler Center for a series of three stand-alone, interrelated lunch seminars that focus on whether direct democracy can be used to fix democracy and counteract the influence of populism. The example he points to is that of the American Progressives of the early twentieth century, like Theodore Roosevelt, who saw initiatives and referendums as a way to make government more responsive.</p>
<p>“People feel they’ve lost control, that someone else has gotten control of the government. Back in the early 20th century, we had a big populist movement. What did they do? They passed the 17th Amendment, which created the direct election of U.S. senators. They passed universal women’s suffrage. They created primary elections so the party’s nominees are chosen by the voters, not by political bosses in smoky back rooms. States also adopted direct democracy in this period as well. In the U.S., the system responded by giving people more control, and that’s what got us over that period, that we made our system more democratic. Direct democracy is a natural way to go when ordinary citizens start to feel it isn’t their government any more.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more conservatives and liberals, from the halls of Congress to people in communities across the country, are agreeing that the so-called &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; needs serious rethinking.</p>
<p>First, we should define our terms. The &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; that was started by Richard Nixon in 1971 and persists to this day, refers to <em>illegal</em> &#8220;street drugs&#8221; &#8212; cocaine, heroin, marijuana and variations thereof. It is not used to mean a war on <em>legal</em> pharmaceuticals, whose excessive and often inappropriate prescribing takes over 100,000 lives a year in our country. Ironically, prescription opioids alone took 35,000 lives last year &#8212; about equal to traffic fatalities.</p>
<p>The argument to criminalize &#8220;street drugs&#8221;, and severely punish their sellers and users, is largely based on the assumption that a &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; approach will reduce addiction and abuse of these dangerous substances. Criminalizing drug use consistently fails to address the health problems of addiction, and drives the drug trade underground where crime, violence and death flourish.</p>
<p>Our country learned this hard lesson firsthand when it prohibited the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in 1920 through the 18<sup>th </sup>Amendment to the Constitution. That led to an underworld of organized crime and illegal undercover stills making &#8220;moonshine&#8221;, whose victims could hardly go for medical treatment. Considered a failure, the amendment was repealed in 1933 with the 21<sup>st </sup>Amendment.</p>
<p>This national experiment with prohibition verified the wise observation of the famous dean of the Harvard Law School, Roscoe Pound, who said that there were certain human behaviors that are beyond &#8220;the effective limits of legal action.&#8221; In short, the law couldn&#8217;t stop the addicting alcohol business; it could only drive it underground.</p>
<p>Legalizing the sale and possession of alcohol allowed people suffering from alcoholism to come out of the shadows and find support through thousands of successful chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous and other treatment options. Alcoholism is still a problem in our country, but it is out in the open where a rational society can address it.</p>
<p>Nicotine from tobacco products is one of the most addictive drugs that people can ingest. Lawmakers since the days of the Virginia tobacco growers in the 17<sup>th</sup> century have not prohibited the smoking of tobacco. For generations, smoking cigarettes and cigars was not considered harmful; it was said to help concentrate your mind on your tasks. The mass media perpetuated such false statements through ads that claimed doctors preferred Lucky Strikes because they were &#8220;less irritating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the historic and widely reported US Surgeon General&#8217;s Report of 1964 concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, accumulating scientific knowledge connecting smoking to lung cancer and a host of other diseases began changing habits.</p>
<p>In 1964 about 44% of American adults smoked regularly; now it is down to 17%. Now smokers cannot indulge on airplanes, buses, trains or in schools, waiting rooms and most office buildings. Had we driven tobacco use underground, organized crime would have claimed the tobacco market and smokers and low-level dealers would have been jailed. If alcohol prohibition taught us the limitations of drug criminalization, efforts to reduce tobacco use have shown what is possible when dangerous products are taxed and regulated and consumers are educated.</p>
<p>So, what about &#8220;street drugs?&#8221; The drug trade is tearing Mexico apart. Just in the past few years, over 50,000 people have been slain by the fights between drug cartels and against police, judges, reporters and innocents who just happen to be in the way of the machine guns. Fear, anxiety, outright terror and political corruption grips large regions of our southern neighbor as the cartel&#8217;s violently work to meet the black market demand in the US and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Drug dealers in the US fight each other, producing violent crimes and terrorized neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To suppress this drug trade the US is spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars a year. Drug cases are clogging our court dockets and crowding out important cases involving corporate crimes and negligence. Low-level drug offenders continue to receive mandatory minimum sentences; filling our prisons and leading to the expansion of the private prison industry whose lobbyists prefer a status quo that commodifies the ruined lives who sustain their profitable inventory.</p>
<p>For decades, conservatives like William F. Buckley and progressives like the then Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, have called for decriminalization, or legalization and regulation, of illegal drugs. We don&#8217;t jail alcoholics for being alcoholics, or incarcerate people for smoking highly addictive cigarettes. Their addictions are treated openly as afflictions to be treated individually and more broadly through sound public policies.</p>
<p>Despite the many calls for reform, the arch-reactionary Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has recently ordered 5,000 federal assistant US attorneys to charge defendants peddling street drugs, many of whom are addicts themselves, with the most serious crimes and impose the toughest penalties possible.</p>
<p>Not so fast, say a growing group of liberal and conservative members of Congress. From Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) to liberal Patrick Leahy (D-VT), lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are joining together to sponsor a bill to end mandatory minimum sentences. Senator Paul said such sentences &#8220;disproportionately affect minorities and low-income communities&#8221; and will worsen the existing &#8220;injustice&#8221; in the criminal justice system, while Senator Leahy declared that as &#8220;an outgrowth of the failed war on drugs, mandatory sentencing strips criminal public-safety resources away from law-enforcement strategies that actually make our communities safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bipartisan bill, S.1127, is already supported by 37 Senators and 79 members of the House. Both the NAACP and the Koch brothers support this legislation!</p>
<p>We need more open debates about the impact of the &#8220;war on drugs.&#8221; As Justice Louis Brandeis said years ago &#8212; &#8220;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&#8221;</p>
