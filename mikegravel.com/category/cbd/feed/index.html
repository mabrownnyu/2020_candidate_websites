								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MESQUITE, NV / ACCESSWIRE / July 26, 2016 / Cannabis Sativa. Inc. (OTCQB: CBDS) announced today<br />
the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to acquire Ibudtender, the first truly smart cannabis web app<br />
tailored as a virtual budtender for patients, as well as a B2B &amp; B2 app for dispensaries and cannabis<br />
businesses. Ibudtender’s preferential user and medical data makes it simple for patients, dispensaries, and<br />
consumers to locate cannabis, hemp and ancillary products while mitigating concerns regarding safety and<br />
effectiveness.</p>
<p>Cannabis Sativa President, David Tobias stated, “There is simply no other app or website that provides the level<br />
of integration that Ibudtender does. Ibudtender’s premium profiles create consumer confidence, trust and<br />
product awareness by providing a portal for consumers to easily locate products and order them for pickup,<br />
delivery or shipping. Customers include services, collective growers, distributors, dispensaries, retail and<br />
ecommerce stores.”</p>
<p>Chris Cope, CEO of Ibudtender stated, “With the help and support from the great team at Cannabis Sativa, I am<br />
confident that IBudtender will become the premier cannabis app.”</p>
<p>Ibudtender provides their clients with the software and analytical data to help promote and grow their brands<br />
and sales by providing a tailored experience for each user that makes them the forefront of the software. Every<br />
aspect is complimented with inline user data, likes and recommendations. By creating a personalized<br />
patient/recreational user experience, Ibudtender provides a one-of- a-kind engagement level including news,<br />
events, strain and product recommendations, all based on a social media platform.</p>
<p>Management of Cannabis Sativa will present the acquisition to its board of directors for approval and thereafter<br />
expects to enter into a definitive acquisition agreement within a week&#8217;s time, or as soon thereafter as is<br />
practicable.</p>
