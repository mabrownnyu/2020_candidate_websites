<p>It is hard to give up something you claim you never had. That is the 
difficulty Americans face with respect to their country’s empire. Since 
the era of Theodore Roosevelt, politicians, journalists, and even some 
historians have deployed euphemisms—“expansionism,” “the large policy,” 
“internationalism,” “global leadership”—to disguise America’s imperial 
ambitions. According to the exceptionalist creed embraced by both 
political parties and most of the press, imperialism was a European 
venture that involved seizing territories, extracting their resources, 
and dominating their (invariably dark-skinned) populations. Americans, 
we have been told, do things differently: they bestow self-determination
 on backward peoples who yearn for it. The refusal to acknowledge that 
Americans have pursued their own version of empire—with the same 
self-deceiving hubris as Europeans—makes it hard to see that the US 
empire might (like the others) have a limited lifespan. All empires 
eventually end, but maybe an exceptional force for global good could 
last forever—or so its champions seem to believe.</p>



<p>The refusal to 
contemplate the scaling back of empire shuts down what ought to be our 
most urgent foreign policy debate before it has even begun. That is why 
these two new books are so necessary, and so welcome: they are the most 
serious efforts since Chalmers Johnson’s <em>Blowback</em> series (2004–2010) to reopen the question of American empire by taking for granted that it exists. Victor Bulmer-Thomas’s<em> Empire in Retreat</em>
 maintains that America has harbored imperial ambitions since its 
founding, and argues that its focus shifted in the twentieth century, 
from acquiring territory to penetrating foreign countries and 
influencing their governments to support US strategic and economic 
interests. David Hendrickson’s <em>Republic in Peril</em> sees that shift as the result of a decisive embrace of interventionism, aimed at extending US power throughout the world.</p>



<p>Both
 authors think withdrawal from overextended military commitments could 
strengthen America. Bulmer-Thomas, a British diplomat and scholar, 
recommends it as a pragmatic adjustment to shrinking support for US 
empire at home and abroad. Hendrickson, a political scientist at 
Colorado College, provides a theoretical rationale for it, exploring the
 possibility of what he calls a new internationalism, based on respect 
for the sovereignty of other nations. Yet even as they catalog the many 
signs of imperial decline (economic, political, cultural), neither is 
sanguine that American policymakers can manage a graceful retreat.</p>



<p>Bulmer-Thomas
 begins by recounting the rise of the US territorial empire. He shows 
that America’s relationship with the land it acquired during westward 
expansion resembled the relationship between European countries and 
their colonies abroad. The United States, like European colonial powers,
 subjugated (and nearly exterminated) aboriginal populations; used 
military occupation as a buffer between white settlers and rebellious 
natives; and established only limited representative governments in 
their occupied territories. One resident of America’s territories 
complained that they were treated like “mere colonies, occupying much 
the same relation to the General Government as the colonies did to the 
British government prior to the Revolution.”</p>



<p>Most textbooks date 
the beginning of America’s overseas expansion to 1898, when it acquired 
sovereignty over Cuba, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines after the 
conclusion of its war with Spain. Yet as Bulmer-Thomas shows, the US 
empire went offshore much earlier. During the 1810s and 1820s, Americans
 carved out the state of Liberia in West Africa, allegedly as a refuge 
for free American blacks; the country in fact functioned as an American 
colony and later as a protectorate of the Firestone Rubber Company. The 
US established an imperial presence in East Asia as early as 1844, when 
the Treaty of Wanghia gave it the same privileged access to Chinese 
ports as the British Empire, and went on to acquire dozens of “guano 
islands” in the Pacific, where abundant bird droppings provided a rich 
source of fertilizer.</p>



<p>During the 1890s, the 
American zeal for distant acquisitions slipped into high gear, as 
politicians realized they were arriving late to the imperial game. Led 
by Theodore Roosevelt and other advocates of expansion, they sought land
 through annexation and collaboration with American business interests 
(Hawaii) as well as through war with Spain. These acquisitions began as 
additions to the territorial empire but gradually acquired a more 
ambiguous character. They came to form the foundation of what 
Bulmer-Thomas calls America’s “semi-global empire,” built not on 
territorial acquisition but on the maintenance of client states and 
various other forms of international interference, including military 
bases that supported occasional armed interventions in local conflicts 
and multinational corporations run mostly by Americans.</p>



<p>The 
Philippines offers a case in point of America’s nonterritorial form of 
empire. The US declared war on Spain in 1898 with the avowed intention 
of ending Spanish rule in Cuba, but even before the declaration 
President William McKinley had dispatched the US Asiatic Squadron under 
Commodore George Dewey to Hong Kong in preparation for an assault on the
 Spanish fleet in Manila Bay. As soon as war was declared, Dewey moved 
quickly and crushed the Spanish forces. Their surrender emboldened the 
Filipino rebels, who erroneously assumed that the US had arrived to 
liberate them from their Spanish oppressors. The US military quickly 
disabused them of that delusion by embarking on a ferocious 
counterinsurgency campaign, which lasted for years and included the 
systematic torture and slaughter of Filipinos. As many as 250,000 died, 
but the US imperialists never doubted the sanctity of their cause. 
“Nothing can be more preposterous than the proposition that these men 
were entitled to receive from us sovereignty over the entire country 
which we were invading,” Secretary of War Elihu Root said in 1900 about 
the Filipino rebels. “As well the friendly Indians, who have helped us 
in our Indian wars, might have claimed the sovereignty of the West.”</p>



<p>Statehood
 was never considered during the debate over the Philippines: the only 
question was whether to establish a naval base at Manila and give the 
islands back to the Spanish or to annex the entire archipelago. The 
imperialists won the argument, and after the insurgents were finally 
suppressed the Philippines became a colony, from which investors in 
sugar, hemp, tobacco, and coconut oil could gain privileged access to US
 markets and Filipinos could emigrate to America in search of jobs. By 
the 1930s, congressional opposition to cheap exports as well as to cheap
 (and nonwhite) labor created support for Philippine independence, which
 was finally achieved in 1946. But it came with so many restrictions on 
trade and so much preferential treatment for American investors—not to 
mention continued maintenance of US military bases—that “it would be 
more accurate to describe the Philippines as becoming a US 
protectorate,” Bulmer-Thomas writes. “Thus, the end of colonialism in 
the Philippines did not mean the end of US imperial control.”</p>



<p>A 
similar pattern of indirect imperial control also applied to Central 
America and the Caribbean. The US dominated that region during the 
twentieth century through colonies (Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the
 Panama Canal Zone), but more broadly by using its economic influence to
 interfere in domestic politics and maintain governments that would 
faithfully serve American interests (as was the case in Cuba until 
1959), or by establishing asymmetrical bilateral treaties and customs 
receiverships—the collection of customs duties by US officials, who then
 used the money to pay off the debt service owed on American loans. This
 arrangement survived in the Dominican Republic until 1942 and in Haiti 
until 1947.</p>



<p>Military interventions underwrote economic domination.
 Sometimes this involved sending in the US Marines and leaving them in 
place for decades, as in Haiti from 1915 to 1934. Sometimes it required 
using military force to crush a rebellion and arranging for the 
emergence of a cooperative dictator, such as Rafael Trujillo in the 
Dominican Republic, whose brutalities the Americans tolerated as long as
 he respected US strategic interests in the region. This he did for 
thirty years, until his attempt in 1960 to overthrow the Venezuelan 
government cost him US support. Sensing an opportunity, his opponents 
assassinated him. But the US was still committed to maintaining the 
imperial relationship, and President Lyndon Johnson sent in the Marines 
in 1965 to prevent the left-of-center president Juan Bosch (who had been
 ousted by a military coup) from returning to power.</p>



<p>Johnson’s
 intervention recalled the conflicts of the early twentieth century, but
 during World War II and the cold war, US imperial strategies had begun 
to shift. As the USSR consolidated its power, the US scaled back its 
pursuit of territory abroad. Instead, it extended its imperial reach 
through the development of international institutions that would serve 
its interests but could not also be used against it. At Bretton Woods in
 1944, the US initiated the creation of the <abbr>IMF</abbr> and the 
World Bank. Both institutions are headquartered in Washington, and the 
president of the World Bank has always been an American, by custom if 
not fiat.</p>



<p>The Point Four Program, drawn from Harry Truman’s 
inaugural address in 1949, linked the World Bank to the struggle with 
the Soviet Union for influence in the developing world, where the bank 
would make loans, with many political conditions attached, to 
governments and state-owned enterprises (later privately owned ones as 
well). The requirement that Congress approve these loans ensured that 
they would reflect what the US government considered its national 
interest. The United Nations, too, began as an American-dominated 
institution, though as its membership grew it became progressively 
harder for the US to control. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization, 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and bilateral treaties worldwide 
also served American policy under the guise of “collective security” 
against the Soviet threat.</p>



<p>All these arrangements were fortified 
by the principle articulated in the Truman Doctrine of 1947—that 
aggression must be stopped everywhere. Such a commitment “assumes that 
foreign conflicts feature evil aggressors and innocent victims,” as 
Hendrickson writes. This unexamined assumption was endorsed and promoted
 by leaders from both political parties, who helped sustain an 
atmosphere of perpetual moral crisis during the cold war. The US, 
working through the <abbr>CIA</abbr>, helped to overthrow elected 
left-leaning governments in Iran, Guatemala, Congo, Brazil, and Chile. 
Interventions anywhere could always be rationalized as 
counterinterventions against the allegedly omnipresent Soviet threat.</p>



<p>When
 the cold war ended, the US’s geopolitical rationale for military 
interventionism—the need to contain communism—swiftly disappeared, as 
the country found itself in the heady position of being the world’s sole
 superpower. This was what is now viewed, with some nostalgia, as the 
unipolar moment. And yet even in the absence of its longtime ideological
 rival, the United States continued to conduct foreign policy with the 
same moral fervor that had informed its actions in the cold war, and 
with the same confidence that it was a force for global good.</p>



<p>Under
 the presidency of Bill Clinton, much of official Washington began to 
believe “that US empire would best be served by the promotion of 
democracy abroad—or at least an American version of democracy—on the 
grounds that US security, free market economies and democracies are 
mutually reenforcing,” as Bulmer-Thomas writes. The rationale for 
democracy promotion, in the words of Clinton’s first National Security 
Strategy, was that “democratic states are less likely to threaten our 
interests and more likely to cooperate with the US to meet security 
threats and promote sustainable development.” This formulation could 
work in some circumstances, but not all. Other nations could have good 
reasons to see democracy promotion as a form of aggression, as Russia 
did when Clinton sought to expand <abbr>NATO</abbr> eastward despite the
 promises made by his predecessors in the first Bush administration and 
the warnings of many seasoned diplomats, led by George Kennan.</p>



<p>Establishing
 “US hegemony across the globe,” in Bulmer-Thomas’s words, was not only 
about promoting democracy abroad but also about maintaining military 
supremacy everywhere. In 2000, despite cuts in personnel and the closure
 of many US bases, the Defense Department committed itself to the 
pursuit of “full spectrum dominance.” This goal, outlined in <em>Joint Vision 2020</em>,
 the Department of Defense’s blueprint for the future, meant the 
worldwide control of land, sea, air, and space, including cyberspace.</p>



<p>The
 triumphalist mood following the end of the cold war also emboldened 
neoconservative ideologues. Two of them, William Kristol and Robert 
Kagan, founded the Project for the New American Century in 1997. Its 
“Statement of Principles” pledged to “rally support for American global 
leadership” through “a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral 
clarity.” This was nothing if not an exceptionalist, even unilateralist 
creed, based on faith in the uniqueness of America’s position as a 
global leader. It evoked Secretary of State Madeleine Albright’s claim 
that the US was “the indispensable nation.”</p>



<p>The 
neoconservatives found their president in George W. Bush. Even before 
the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Bush began to implement 
neoconservative policies, withdrawing from international organizations 
and agreements—including (in June 2002) the Anti-Ballistic Missile 
Treaty with Russia. This decision, according to Ivo Daalder of the 
Brookings Institution and other critics at the time, signaled a swerve 
in US nuclear strategy from deterrence to “war-fighting.”</p>



<p>The 
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon provided a new 
enemy, international terrorism, that was even more shadowy and elusive 
than international communism had been. Widespread panic among Americans 
and their allies was taken (especially in the US) to justify a permanent
 state of emergency, with damaging consequences for civil liberties and 
public debate at home, as well as for the many thousands of civilians 
who would become “collateral damage” in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>



<p>After
 September 11, new rationales for military intervention abroad 
emerged—not only preventative war against terror (the false 
justification for invading Iraq) but also <abbr>R2P</abbr> (the Responsibility to Protect). As Hendrickson shows, <abbr>R2P</abbr>
 originated in the recommendation of a Canadian government commission 
and received a modified but contested acceptance by the UN in 2005. <abbr>R2P</abbr>
 provides a virtually blank check for using force on humanitarian 
grounds—an idea that has little support from non-Western nations. In 
practice it vitiates a central assumption of international law—that each
 state has the right to defend itself. In his second inaugural address, 
Bush spelled out the vision of universal empire behind <abbr>R2P</abbr>: “The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world.” This was the Truman Doctrine on steroids.</p>



<p>Hendrickson
 thinks American disregard for international law helps explain the 
incoherence of contemporary strategic thought. According to 
exceptionalist ideology, the US is the primary guardian of international
 law, on which global stability depends. Yet Hendrickson (like 
Bulmer-Thomas) makes clear that more often than not, the putative 
rule-maker has in fact broken rules and acted in ways that it would not 
tolerate from any other nation.</p>



<p>The American exceptionalist double
 standard is especially apparent in its current military operations 
overseas. Consider the battle-ready presence of the US Navy in the South
 China Sea. Imagine a rival power behaving as aggressively in the 
Caribbean, lecturing us on our misdeeds (as we have lectured the 
Chinese) and appointing itself a neutral umpire for the region. A 
retired Chinese admiral, quoted by Hendrickson, puts the matter 
succinctly: the US Navy in East Asia is like “a man with a criminal 
record ‘wandering just outside the gates of a family home.’”</p>



<p>Or take the confrontation emerging on the western border of Russia. The missile defense system installed by <abbr>NATO</abbr> on Russia’s doorstep, combined with <abbr>NATO</abbr>
 troops conducting military exercises, could not be more provocative. No
 great power, least of all the United States, would allow deployments so
 close to its borders without protest and (probably) retaliation.</p>



<p>While
 Bulmer-Thomas treats imperial expansion as a continuous feature of 
American history that has run afoul of historical circumstance, 
Hendrickson reconstructs an anti-imperial tradition in Anglophone 
thought, which he calls “liberal pluralism” and recommends reviving in 
view of our crumbling American empire. In his view, liberal pluralism 
was embodied in the system of European nation-states (the “Westphalian 
system”) that emerged from the Thirty Years’ War. It was also the 
worldview of America’s founders, uniting Washington, Jefferson, 
Hamilton, and Madison in their suspicion of military adventures abroad. 
From the liberal pluralist perspective, war is the <em>summum malum</em> 
of international affairs; respect for the sovereignty of other nations 
is the best way to avoid it. Sovereignty is the core of international 
law: every state has the right to defend itself from external attack; 
none has the right to interfere in the internal affairs of another.</p>



<p>The  fact that liberal pluralism discourages interference does not, however,  imply that it encourages nations to be passive bystanders in the face  of immoral foreign policies, as contemporary political theorists who  favor an interventionist approach like to claim. Liberal pluralism “does  not,” Hendrickson insists, “dictate indifference to human rights”; it  allows states to shelter dissidents and welcome refugees from  oppression. “What it does not allow is coercive intervention in a  foreign country to secure those rights.”</p>

<p>Hendrickson concentrates his criticisms on the reckless use of 
military force in foreign lands; he does not dismiss economic sanctions 
as an alternative. Nor does he rule out interference in extreme 
situations, such as the threat of genocide. But he insists that such 
interventions be—as far as possible—multilateral, peaceful, and 
respectful of international law. He proposes maintaining <abbr>NATO</abbr>,
 but with our nuclear guarantees to its members on a strictly 
“no-first-use” basis; preserving friendships with allies but also 
working out “rules of the road with putative adversaries.” He argues 
that fighting terrorism requires effective policing at home and the 
support of functioning governments abroad, not their overthrow. The 
liberal pluralist tradition, in his view, provides intellectual 
resources for reducing international tension and redirecting national 
wealth toward urgently necessary aims—rebuilding infrastructure, 
reviving the welfare state, and addressing the menace of climate change 
and oceanic catastrophe.</p>



<p>In recent years, popular 
support for imperial adventures has waned. Large majorities have opposed
 sending US troops to Libya, Syria, and Ukraine. The percentage of 
Americans who think it is “very important” that the US should “maintain 
superior military power worldwide” dropped from 68 percent in 2002 to 52
 percent in 2014. And poll respondents ranked military supremacy sixth 
out of ten among foreign policy aims. The top-ranked goal was 
“protecting the jobs of American workers.”</p>



<p>The shift in public 
opinion is a response to a series of failed interventions: efforts at 
regime change in Iraq, Libya, and Syria have left behind chaos, failed 
states, terrorist recruits, and endless war. But whatever disagreements 
they may have had over policy details, all three presidents since 
September 11 have shared a commitment to US global military supremacy. 
No major policymaker wants to admit publicly what many suspect 
privately: that America’s imperial reach has begun to exceed its grasp. 
Barring a dramatic shift in public discourse, the American empire will 
not go gentle into that good night; more likely it will, as Dylan Thomas
 counseled the old, “burn and rave at close of day.”</p>



<p>No one burns 
and raves more flagrantly than Donald Trump. The failure of blank-check 
interventions fed the discontent he exploited in the 2016 campaign. Yet 
his chauvinist posturing has turned out to be little more than a 
belligerent, unhinged version of the militarized globalism he claimed to
 displace. So Trump lurches from one outrageous provocation to another 
while most of his critics repeat the stale formulas of global 
leadership. Neither side seems to notice that the rest of the world does
 not want to be led (though some countries may still want their security
 to be guaranteed by US power). More and more foreign countries are 
trying to go about their business on their own, even in areas once 
assumed to be vital to the US national interest—Latin America, the 
Middle East, the South China Sea, even the Korean peninsula, where the 
South Koreans have done what American leaders were unable or unwilling 
to do: initiate diplomacy with North Korea.</p>



<p>Other pillars of 
American power are also crumbling, as Bulmer-Thomas demonstrates in 
detail. Multinational corporations are no longer as dependent on 
American policies abroad for access to foreign markets; General Motors, 
for example, now sells more cars in China than anywhere else on earth, 
without benefit of a US presence there. Recent years have seen a steady 
fall in the US net investment ratio (gross investment less the 
consumption of fixed capital), both private and public. The consequence 
has been a decline in infrastructure (including public education), as 
well as a slowing of innovation and productivity. At the same time, 
neoliberal politicians in both parties, committed to cutting back the 
“entitlements” provided by the welfare state and privatizing the public 
sector, have underwritten the rise of inequality and social immobility. 
The effect has been to undermine the broad prosperity that was the 
domestic basis of the semi-global empire.</p>



<p>International institutions, rather than reinforcing American hegemony, challenge it. The UN, the <abbr>IMF</abbr>,
 and the World Bank have all proven unreliable in promoting US 
interests. At the UN, the US is more isolated than ever on the Security 
Council, as the dramatic increase in American vetoes shows. Various 
countries have learned to avoid borrowing from the <abbr>IMF</abbr>, 
with the onerous conditions it imposes, by building up their foreign 
exchange reserves and paying off existing debts. The World Bank now has 
two significant rivals, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the
 New Development Bank (which represents the <abbr>BRICS</abbr> 
countries: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The 
Organization of American States has been superseded, since 2011, by the 
Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, which insisted on the 
inclusion of Cuba despite US opposition. China is creating its own 
version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership without US participation, as 
well as expanding into sub-Saharan Africa and cutting a deal with 
Nicaragua for another isthmian canal.</p>



<p>Yet Trump and his opponents 
in the Washington consensus still envision a unipolar world, where the 
United States can ignore the legitimate claims of rival nations and do 
pretty much whatever it wants, whether because of its sheer greatness 
(Trump) or its exceptional goodness (Clinton et al.). Obama was cautious
 about intervening in Syria and eager to negotiate with Iran, but his 
administration maintained or intensified commitments to global military 
supremacy, blanket surveillance, targeted drone assassinations, and 
modernization of nuclear weapons, as well as engagement in the Middle 
East and East Asia. Fundamental policies persisted despite Obama’s 
misgivings.</p>



<p>Neither Bulmer-Thomas nor Hendrickson believes these  policies can continue without catastrophe. And it might, in any case,  not be in the US’s interests for them to continue. As Bulmer-Thomas  reminds us, “Imperial retreat is not the same as national decline, as  many other countries can attest. Indeed, imperial retreat can strengthen  the nation-state just as imperial expansion can weaken it.” Yet as  Hendrickson concludes, “It is crystal clear that the empire is fully  determined to stick around,” despite our desperate need to dismantle it.  The drift of global events may eventually require the United States to  acknowledge the reality of a multipolar world, but we cannot assume that  the process will be peaceful. Still, Hendrickson has performed an  urgently necessary service in reconstructing the liberal pluralist  tradition. He reminds us that there is a humane alternative to  contemporary orthodoxy, if we can only recognize it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The former Democratic senator who entered the classified “Pentagon Papers” into the Congressional Record, making them public, says House Intelligence Committee Republicans are cowards if they let the executive branch block release of a memo on alleged surveillance abuse.</p>
<p>Former Sen. Mike Gravel of Alaska said Republicans on the committee would demonstrate “the height of cowardice” if they abandon efforts to release the memo after voting to do so Monday evening.</p>
<div class="connatix_player float-left mr-2 hidden-print"></div>
<p>Gravel said lawmakers should be willing to unilaterally release classified documents if they feel it&#8217;s in the public interest, as he did with the secret Vietnam War study.</p>
<p>“The criteria for releasing anything is this: Is this something the people should know? If the Republicans feel this should be made public for the benefit of their constituents, fine, release it. The Democrats should do the same. But there is no argument to be made this stuff is secret and it’s too important for the people to know,” Gravel said after the committee voted along party lines for release.</p>
<p>“I’m not advocating it be done by the man on the street,&#8221; he added. &#8220;I’m advocating this be done by people who are duly elected and sworn to protect the Constitution. We cannot have a vibrant democracy if the American people don’t know what the government is doing.”</p>
<p>The Justice Department said last week that release of the memo would be “extraordinarily reckless” without executive branch review. Democrats who have read the document say it is misleading and risks unmasking important secrets.</p>
<p>Still, House Intelligence Committee Republicans voted for the release and started a five-day waiting period, during which President Trump can object to release. The memo is believed to address Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act-related activities pertaining to the 2016 Trump campaign.</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t object, we can <div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

						[publish]. If he objects, we can refer it for a vote of the full House,” a House Intelligence Committee Republican source said late last week.</p>
<p>Gravel said Republicans should not back down if they meet resistance from administration officials.</p>
<p>“For the Congress to be a bunch of wimps and cowards and defer to the executive branch because they don’t want to take any responsibility is the height of cowardice,” he said.</p>
<p>In June 1971, Gravel convened a subcommittee he chaired and released thousands of pages of the Pentagon Papers into the Congressional Record, ensuring they would remain public as the Nixon administration challenged in court the right to report on the leaked document.</p>
<p>“All this brouhaha between the executive and the legislative is ridiculous. It’s all because these people don’t understand their responsibility under the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause,” Gravel said. “There is no legal risk on their part for releasing information they feel the public should know. No risk. Period.”</p>
<p>Gravel won the 1972 Supreme Court case Gravel v. U.S., with justices finding the Constitution’s Speech or Debate Clause immunized not only his release of the classified records, but also covered the participation of his staff.</p>
<p>The memo on alleged FISA abuse has resulted in notable party unity in the House, where debates on surveillance often are characterized by bipartisan pushes for privacy protections against a bipartisan consensus in favor of the status quo among leadership.</p>
<p>Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a longtime FISA reform advocate, <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/leading-fisa-critics-in-congress-split-along-party-lines-on-release-the-memo-push/article/2647126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told the <em>Examiner</em></a> last week she read the short memo and felt it should not be released. She said it “was crafted in a way that would create a misimpression based on classified information that I’ve reviewed long ago and cites sources that are highly classified.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lofgren said release would set up a secondary fight for release of the highly classified underpinnings.</p>
<p>“I can’t talk about this memo, but I think — critical as I’ve been about a lack of a warrant requirement [for domestic communications under FISA] — there still are things that shouldn’t be published. We have spies; they have spies. To think every single thing that has been done by intelligence agencies should be published, I think, is incorrect,” she said.</p>
<p>On the Republican side, there’s been a groundswell of support for release among rank-and-file members, many of whom shared their demands for release under the social media hashtag #ReleasetheMemo last week.</p>
<p>Members of the House are allowed to read the memo, but senators, including those on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have complained about not having access. House members who read the memo must do so in a secure room supervised by committee staff.</p>
<p>Although Lofgren said “it was not a long memo,” she questioned how a member of Congress would sneak a copy out of the secure reading room.</p>
<p>Gravel said even if lawmakers are guarded in the reading room, they can easily find a way to sneak a copy into a press release or official proceeding.</p>
<p>“Obviously then they have to be intelligent enough to get a copy of the document,” he said. “This is ridiculous, the Congress does leak like a sieve and if a person is intelligent and intent on releasing this information, it’s not that difficult. They just pretend it is to cover their backsides.”</p>

<h2>Jackson Lears</h2>
<div id="OA_aff8600f" class="subscriber-ad print-hide" title="essay"></div>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcapslede">American politics</span> have rarely presented a more disheartening spectacle. The repellent and dangerous antics of Donald Trump are troubling enough, but so is the Democratic Party leadership’s failure to take in the significance of the 2016 election campaign. Bernie Sanders’s challenge to Hillary Clinton, combined with Trump’s triumph, revealed the breadth of popular anger at politics as usual – the blend of neoliberal domestic policy and interventionist foreign policy that constitutes consensus in Washington. Neoliberals celebrate market utility as the sole criterion of worth; interventionists exalt military adventure abroad as a means of fighting evil in order to secure global progress. Both agendas have proved calamitous for most Americans. Many registered their disaffection in 2016. Sanders is a social democrat and Trump a demagogic mountebank, but their campaigns underscored a widespread repudiation of the Washington consensus. For about a week after the election, pundits discussed the possibility of a more capacious Democratic strategy. It appeared that the party might learn something from Clinton’s defeat. Then everything changed.</p>
<div id="article-body" class=" mpu">
<p>A story that had circulated during the campaign without much effect resurfaced: it involved the charge that Russian operatives had hacked into the servers of the Democratic National Committee, revealing embarrassing emails that damaged Clinton’s chances. With stunning speed, a new centrist-liberal orthodoxy came into being, enveloping the major media and the bipartisan Washington establishment. This secular religion has attracted hordes of converts in the first year of the Trump presidency. In its capacity to exclude dissent, it is like no other formation of mass opinion in my adult life, though it recalls a few dim childhood memories of anti-communist hysteria during the early 1950s.</p>
<p>The centrepiece of the faith, based on the hacking charge, is the belief that Vladimir Putin orchestrated an attack on American democracy by ordering his minions to interfere in the election on behalf of Trump. The story became gospel with breathtaking suddenness and completeness. Doubters are perceived as heretics and as apologists for Trump and Putin, the evil twins and co-conspirators behind this attack on American democracy. Responsibility for the absence of debate lies in large part with the major media outlets. Their uncritical embrace and endless repetition of the Russian hack story have made it seem a fait accompli in the public mind. It is hard to estimate popular belief in this new orthodoxy, but it does not seem to be merely a creed of Washington insiders. If you question the received narrative in casual conversations, you run the risk of provoking blank stares or overt hostility – even from old friends. This has all been baffling and troubling to me; there have been moments when pop-culture fantasies (body snatchers, Kool-Aid) have come to mind.</p>
<p>Like any orthodoxy worth its salt, the religion of the Russian hack depends not on evidence but on ex cathedra pronouncements on the part of authoritative institutions and their overlords. Its scriptural foundation is a confused and largely fact-free ‘assessment’ produced last January by a small number of ‘hand-picked’ analysts – as James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, described them – from the CIA, the FBI and the NSA. The claims of the last were made with only ‘moderate’ confidence. The label Intelligence Community Assessment creates a misleading impression of unanimity, given that only three of the 16 US intelligence agencies contributed to the report. And indeed the assessment itself contained this crucial admission: ‘Judgments are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be a fact. Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation and precedents.’ Yet the assessment has passed into the media imagination as if it were unassailable fact, allowing journalists to assume what has yet to be proved. In doing so they serve as mouthpieces for the intelligence agencies, or at least for those ‘hand-picked’ analysts.</p>
<p>It is not the first time the intelligence agencies have played this role. When I hear the Intelligence Community Assessment cited as a reliable source, I always recall the part played by the <em>New York Times</em> in legitimating CIA reports of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s putative weapons of mass destruction, not to mention the long history of disinformation (a.k.a. ‘fake news’) as a tactic for advancing one administration or another’s political agenda. Once again, the established press is legitimating pronouncements made by the Church Fathers of the national security state. Clapper is among the most vigorous of these. He perjured himself before Congress in 2013, when he denied that the NSA had ‘wittingly’ spied on Americans – a lie for which he has never been held to account. In May 2017, he told NBC’s Chuck Todd that the Russians were highly likely to have colluded with Trump’s campaign because they are ‘almost genetically driven to co-opt, penetrate, gain favour, whatever, which is a typical Russian technique’. The current orthodoxy exempts the Church Fathers from standards imposed on ordinary people, and condemns Russians – above all Putin – as uniquely, ‘almost genetically’ diabolical.</p>
<p>It’s hard for me to understand how the Democratic Party, which once felt scepticism towards the intelligence agencies, can now embrace the CIA and the FBI as sources of incontrovertible truth. One possible explanation is that Trump’s election has created a permanent emergency in the liberal imagination, based on the belief that the threat he poses is unique and unprecedented. It’s true that Trump’s menace is viscerally real. But the menace posed by George W. Bush and Dick Cheney was equally real. The damage done by Bush and Cheney – who ravaged the Middle East, legitimated torture and expanded unconstitutional executive power – was truly unprecedented, and probably permanent. Trump does pose an unprecedented threat to undocumented immigrants and Muslim travellers, whose protection is urgent and necessary. But on most issues he is a standard issue Republican. He is perfectly at home with Paul Ryan’s austerity agenda, which involves enormous transfers of wealth to the most privileged Americans. He is as committed as any other Republican to repealing Obama’s Affordable Care Act. During the campaign he posed as an apostate on free trade and an opponent of overseas military intervention, but now that he is in office his free trade views are shifting unpredictably and his foreign policy team is composed of generals with impeccable interventionist credentials.</p>
<p>Trump is committed to continuing his predecessors’ lavish funding of the already bloated Defence Department, and his Fortress America is a blustering, undisciplined version of Madeleine Albright’s ‘indispensable nation’. Both Trump and Albright assume that the United States should be able to do as it pleases in the international arena: Trump because it’s the greatest country in the world, Albright because it’s an exceptional force for global good. Nor is there anything unprecedented about Trump’s desire for détente with Russia, which until at least 2012 was the official position of the Democratic Party. What is unprecedented about Trump is his offensive style: contemptuous, bullying, inarticulate, and yet perfectly pitched to appeal to the anger and anxiety of his target audience. His excess has licensed overt racism and proud misogyny among some of his supporters. This is cause for denunciation, but I am less persuaded that it justifies the anti-Russian mania.</p>
<p>Besides Trump’s supposed uniqueness, there are two other assumptions behind the furore in Washington: the first is that the Russian hack unquestionably occurred, and the second is that the Russians are our implacable enemies. The second provides the emotional charge for the first. Both seem to me problematic. With respect to the first, the hacking charges are unproved and may well remain so. Edward Snowden and others familiar with the NSA say that if long-distance hacking had taken place the agency would have monitored it and could detail its existence without compromising their secret sources and methods. In September, Snowden told <em>Der Spiegel</em> that the NSA ‘probably knows quite well who the invaders were’. And yet ‘it has not presented any evidence, although I suspect it exists. The question is: why not? … I suspect it discovered other attackers in the systems, maybe there were six or seven groups at work.’ The NSA’s capacity to follow hacking to its source is a matter of public record. When the agency investigated pervasive and successful Chinese hacking into US military and defence industry installations, it was able to trace the hacks to the building where they originated, a People’s Liberation Army facility in Shanghai. That information was published in the <em>New York Times</em> but, this time, the NSA’s failure to provide evidence has gone curiously unremarked. When <em>The Intercept</em> published a story about the NSA’s alleged discovery that Russian military intelligence had attempted to hack into US state and local election systems, the agency’s undocumented assertions about the Russian origins of the hack were allowed to stand as unchallenged fact and quickly became treated as such in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there has been a blizzard of ancillary accusations, including much broader and vaguer charges of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. It remains possible that Robert Mueller, a former FBI director who has been appointed to investigate these allegations, may turn up some compelling evidence of contacts between Trump’s people and various Russians. It would be surprising if an experienced prosecutor empowered to cast a dragnet came up empty-handed, and the arrests have already begun. But what is striking about them is that the charges have nothing to do with Russian interference in the election. There has been much talk about the possibility that the accused may provide damaging evidence against Trump in exchange for lighter sentences, but this is merely speculation. Paul Manafort, at one point Trump’s campaign manager, has pleaded not guilty to charges of failing to register his public relations firm as a foreign agent for the Ukrainian government and concealing his millions of dollars in fees. But all this occurred before the 2016 campaign. George Papadopolous, a foreign policy adviser, has pleaded guilty to the charge of lying to the FBI about his bungling efforts to arrange a meeting between Trump’s people and the Russian government – an opportunity the Trump campaign declined. Mueller’s most recent arrestee, Michael Flynn, the unhinged Islamophobe who was briefly Trump’s national security adviser, has pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador in December – weeks after the election. This is the sort of backchannel diplomacy that routinely occurs during the interim between one administration and the next. It is not a sign of collusion.</p>
<p>So far, after months of ‘bombshells’ that turn out to be duds, there is still no actual evidence for the claim that the Kremlin ordered interference in the American election. Meanwhile serious doubts have surfaced about the technical basis for the hacking claims. Independent observers have argued it is more likely that the emails were leaked from inside, not hacked from outside. On this front, the most persuasive case was made by a group called Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity, former employees of the US intelligence agencies who distinguished themselves in 2003 by debunking Colin Powell’s claim that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, hours after Powell had presented his pseudo-evidence at the UN. (There are members of VIPS who dissent from the VIPS report’s conclusions, but their arguments are in turn contested by the authors of the report.) The VIPS findings received no attention in major media outlets, except Fox News – which from the centre-left perspective is worse than no attention at all. Mainstream media have dismissed the VIPS report as a conspiracy theory (apparently the Russian hacking story does not count as one). The crucial issue here and elsewhere is the exclusion from public discussion of <em>any</em> critical perspectives on the orthodox narrative, even the perspectives of people with professional credentials and a solid track record.</p>
<p>Both the DNC hacking story and the one involving the emails of John Podesta, a Clinton campaign operative, involve a shadowy bunch of putatively Russian hackers called Fancy Bear – also known among the technically inclined as APT28. The name Fancy Bear was introduced by Dimitri Alperovitch, the chief technology officer of Crowdstrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the DNC to investigate the theft of their emails. Alperovitch is also a fellow at the Atlantic Council, an anti-Russian Washington think tank. In its report Crowdstrike puts forward close to zero evidence for its claim that those responsible were Russian, let alone for its assertion that they were affiliated with Russian military intelligence. And yet, from this point on, the assumption that this was a Russian cyber operation was unquestioned. When the FBI arrived on the scene, the Bureau either did not request or was refused access to the DNC servers; instead it depended entirely on the Crowdstrike analysis. Crowdstrike, meanwhile, was being forced to retract another claim, that the Russians had successfully hacked the guidance systems of the Ukrainian artillery. The Ukrainian military and the British International Institute for Strategic Studies both contradicted this claim, and Crowdstrike backed down. But its DNC analysis was allowed to stand and even become the basis for the January Intelligence Community Assessment.</p>
<p>The chatter surrounding the hack would never have acquired such urgency were it not for the accompanying assumption: Russia is a uniquely dangerous adversary, with which we should avoid all contact. Without that belief, Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s meetings with Russians in September 2016 would become routine discussions between a senator and foreign officials. Flynn’s post-election conversations with the Russian ambassador would appear unremarkable. Trump’s cronies’ attempts to do business in Russia would become merely sleazy. Donald Trump Jr’s meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya would be transformed from a melodrama of shady intrigue to a comedy of errors – with the candidate’s son expecting to receive information to use against Clinton but discovering Veselnitskaya only wanted to talk about repealing sanctions and restarting the flow of Russian orphans to the United States. And Putin himself would become just another autocrat, with whom democracies could engage without endorsing.</p>
<p>Sceptical voices, such as those of the VIPS, have been drowned out by a din of disinformation. Flagrantly false stories, like the <em>Washington Post</em> report that the Russians had hacked into the Vermont electrical grid, are published, then retracted 24 hours later. Sometimes – like the stories about Russian interference in the French and German elections – they are not retracted even after they have been discredited. These stories have been thoroughly debunked by French and German intelligence services but continue to hover, poisoning the atmosphere, confusing debate. The claim that the Russians hacked local and state voting systems in the US was refuted by California and Wisconsin election officials, but their comments generated a mere whisper compared with the uproar created by the original story. The rush to publish without sufficient attention to accuracy has become the new normal in journalism. Retraction or correction is almost beside the point: the false accusation has done its work.</p>
<p class="secast">*</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcapslede">The consequence</span> is a spreading confusion that envelops everything. Epistemological nihilism looms, but some people and institutions have more power than others to define what constitutes an agreed-on reality. To say this is to risk dismissal as the ultimate wing-nut in the lexicon of contemporary Washington: the conspiracy theorist. Still, the fact remains: sometimes powerful people arrange to promote ideas that benefit their common interests. Whether we call this hegemony, conspiracy or merely special privilege hardly matters. What does matter is the power to create what Gramsci called the ‘common sense’ of an entire society. Even if much of that society is indifferent to or suspicious of the official common sense, it still becomes embedded among the tacit assumptions that set the boundaries of ‘responsible opinion’. So the Democratic establishment (along with a few Republicans) and the major media outlets have made ‘Russian meddling’ the common sense of the current moment. What kind of cultural work does this common sense do? What are the consequences of the spectacle the media call (with characteristic originality) ‘Russiagate’?</p>
<p>The most immediate consequence is that, by finding foreign demons who can be blamed for Trump’s ascendancy, the Democratic leadership have shifted the blame for their defeat away from their own policies without questioning any of their core assumptions. Amid the general recoil from Trump, they can even style themselves dissenters – ‘#the resistance’ was the label Clintonites appropriated within a few days of the election. Mainstream Democrats have begun to use the word ‘progressive’ to apply to a platform that amounts to little more than preserving Obamacare, gesturing towards greater income equality and protecting minorities. This agenda is timid. It has nothing to say about challenging the influence of concentrated capital on policy, reducing the inflated defence budget or withdrawing from overextended foreign commitments; yet without those initiatives, even the mildest egalitarian policies face insuperable obstacles. More genuine insurgencies are in the making, which confront corporate power and connect domestic with foreign policy, but they face an uphill battle against the entrenched money and power of the Democratic leadership – the likes of Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, the Clintons and the DNC. Russiagate offers Democratic elites a way to promote party unity against Trump-Putin, while the DNC purges Sanders’s supporters.</p>
<p>For the DNC, the great value of the Russian hack story is that it focuses attention away from what was actually in their emails. The documents revealed a deeply corrupt organisation, whose pose of impartiality was a sham. Even the reliably pro-Clinton <em>Washington Post</em> has admitted that ‘many of the most damaging emails suggest the committee was actively trying to undermine Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign.’ Further evidence of collusion between the Clinton machine and the DNC surfaced recently in a memoir by Donna Brazile, who became interim chair of the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned in the wake of the email revelations. Brazile describes discovering an agreement dated 26 August 2015, which specified (she writes)</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="leftranged">that in exchange for raising money and investing in the DNC, Hillary would control the party’s finances, strategy, and all the money raised. Her campaign had the right of refusal of who would be the party communications director, and it would make final decisions on all the other staff. The DNC also was required to consult with the campaign about all other staffing, budgeting, data, analytics and mailings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="leftranged">Before the primaries had even begun, the supposedly neutral DNC – which had been close to insolvency – had been bought by the Clinton campaign.</p>
<p>Another recent revelation of DNC tactics concerns the origins of the inquiry into Trump’s supposed links to Putin. The story began in April 2016, when the DNC hired a Washington research firm called Fusion GPS to unearth any connections between Trump and Russia. The assignment involved the payment of ‘cash for trash’, as the Clinton campaign liked to say. Fusion GPS eventually produced the trash, a lurid account written by the former British MI6 intelligence agent Christopher Steele, based on hearsay purchased from anonymous Russian sources. Amid prostitutes and golden showers, a story emerged: the Russian government had been blackmailing and bribing Donald Trump for years, on the assumption that he would become president some day and serve the Kremlin’s interests. In this fantastic tale, Putin becomes a preternaturally prescient schemer. Like other accusations of collusion, this one has become vaguer over time, adding to the murky atmosphere without ever providing any evidence. The Clinton campaign tried to persuade established media outlets to publicise the Steele dossier, but with uncharacteristic circumspection, they declined to promote what was plainly political trash rather than reliable reporting. Yet the FBI apparently took the Steele dossier seriously enough to include a summary of it in a secret appendix to the Intelligence Community Assessment. Two weeks before the inauguration, James Comey, the director of the FBI, described the dossier to Trump. After Comey’s briefing was leaked to the press, the website Buzzfeed published the dossier in full, producing hilarity and hysteria in the Washington establishment.</p>
<p>The Steele dossier inhabits a shadowy realm where ideology and intelligence, disinformation and revelation overlap. It is the antechamber to the wider system of epistemological nihilism created by various rival factions in the intelligence community: the ‘tree of smoke’ that, for the novelist Denis Johnson, symbolised CIA operations in Vietnam. I inhaled that smoke myself in 1969-70, when I was a cryptographer with a Top Secret clearance on a US navy ship that carried missiles armed with nuclear warheads – the existence of which the navy denied. I was stripped of my clearance and later honourably discharged when I refused to join the Sealed Authenticator System, which would have authorised the launch of those allegedly non-existent nuclear weapons. The tree of smoke has only grown more complex and elusive since then. Yet the Democratic Party has now embarked on a full-scale rehabilitation of the intelligence community – or at least the part of it that supports the notion of Russian hacking. (We can be sure there is disagreement behind the scenes.) And it is not only the Democratic establishment that is embracing the deep state. Some of the party’s base, believing Trump and Putin to be joined at the hip, has taken to ranting about ‘treason’ like a reconstituted John Birch Society.</p>
<p>I thought of these ironies when I visited the Tate Modern exhibition <em>Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power</em>, which featured the work of black American artists from the 1960s and 1970s, when intelligence agencies (and agents provocateurs) were spearheading a government crackdown on black militants, draft resisters, deserters and antiwar activists. Amid the paintings, collages and assemblages there was a single Confederate flag, accompanied by grim reminders of the Jim Crow past – a Klansman in full regalia, a black body dangling from a tree. There were also at least half a dozen US flags, juxtaposed in whole or in part with images of contemporary racial oppression that could have occurred anywhere in America: dead black men carted off on stretchers by skeletons in police uniform; a black prisoner tied to a chair, awaiting torture. The point was to contrast the pretensions of ‘the land of the free’ with the practices of the national security state and local police forces. The black artists of that era knew their enemy: black people were not being killed and imprisoned by some nebulous foreign adversary, but by the FBI, the CIA and the police.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has now developed a new outlook on the world, a more ambitious partnership between liberal humanitarian interventionists and neoconservative militarists than existed under the cautious Obama. This may be the most disastrous consequence for the Democratic Party of the new anti-Russian orthodoxy: the loss of the opportunity to formulate a more humane and coherent foreign policy. The obsession with Putin has erased any possibility of complexity from the Democratic world picture, creating a void quickly filled by the monochrome fantasies of Hillary Clinton and her exceptionalist allies. For people like Max Boot and Robert Kagan, war is a desirable state of affairs, especially when viewed from the comfort of their keyboards, and the rest of the world – apart from a few bad guys – is filled with populations who want to build societies just like ours: pluralistic, democratic and open for business. This view is difficult to challenge when it cloaks itself in humanitarian sentiment. There is horrific suffering in the world; the US has abundant resources to help relieve it; the moral imperative is clear. There are endless forms of international engagement that do not involve military intervention. But it is the path taken by US policy often enough that one may suspect humanitarian rhetoric is nothing more than window-dressing for a more mundane geopolitics – one that defines the national interest as global and virtually limitless.</p>
<p>Having come of age during the Vietnam War, a calamitous consequence of that inflated definition of national interest, I have always been attracted to the realist critique of globalism. Realism is a label forever besmirched by association with Henry Kissinger, who used it as a rationale for intervening covertly and overtly in other nations’ affairs. Yet there is a more humane realist tradition, the tradition of George Kennan and William Fulbright, which emphasises the limits of military might, counselling that great power requires great restraint. This tradition challenges the doctrine of regime change under the guise of democracy promotion, which – despite its abysmal failures in Iraq and Libya – retains a baffling legitimacy in official Washington. Russiagate has extended its shelf life.</p>
<p class="secast">*</p>
<p class="dropcap"><span class="smallcapslede">We can gauge</span> the corrosive impact of the Democrats’ fixation on Russia by asking what they aren’t talking about when they talk about Russian hacking. For a start, they aren’t talking about interference of other sorts in the election, such as the Republican Party’s many means of disenfranchising minority voters. Nor are they talking about the trillion dollar defence budget that pre-empts the possibility of single-payer healthcare and other urgently needed social programmes; nor about the modernisation of the American nuclear arsenal which Obama began and Trump plans to accelerate, and which raises the risk of the ultimate environmental calamity, nuclear war – a threat made more serious than it has been in decades by America’s combative stance towards Russia. The prospect of impeaching Trump and removing him from office by convicting him of collusion with Russia has created an atmosphere of almost giddy anticipation among leading Democrats, allowing them to forget that the rest of the Republican Party is composed of many politicians far more skilful in Washington’s ways than their president will ever be.</p>
<p>It is not the Democratic Party that is leading the search for alternatives to the wreckage created by Republican policies: a tax plan that will soak the poor and middle class to benefit the rich; a heedless pursuit of fossil fuels that is already resulting in the contamination of the water supply of the Dakota people; and continued support for police policies of militarisation and mass incarceration. It is local populations that are threatened by oil spills and police beatings, and that is where humane populism survives. A multitude of insurgent groups have begun to use the outrage against Trump as a lever to move the party in egalitarian directions: Justice Democrats, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America, as well as a host of local and regional organisations. They recognise that there are far more urgent – and genuine – reasons to oppose Trump than vague allegations of collusion with Russia. They are posing an overdue challenge to the long con of neoliberalism, and the technocratic arrogance that led to Clinton’s defeat in Rust Belt states. Recognising that the current leadership will not bring about significant change, they are seeking funding from outside the DNC. This is the real resistance, as opposed to ‘#theresistance’.</p>
<p>On certain important issues – such as broadening support for single-payer healthcare, promoting a higher minimum wage or protecting undocumented immigrants from the most flagrant forms of exploitation – these insurgents are winning wide support. Candidates like Paula Jean Swearengin, a coal miner’s daughter from West Virginia who is running in the Democratic primary for nomination to the US Senate, are challenging establishment Democrats who stand cheek by jowl with Republicans in their service to concentrated capital. Swearengin’s opponent is Joe Manchin, whom the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> has compared to Doug Jones, another ‘very conservative’ Democrat who recently won election to the US Senate in Alabama, narrowly defeating a Republican disgraced by accusations of sexual misconduct with 14-year-old girls. I can feel relieved at that result without joining in the collective Democratic ecstasy, which reveals the party’s persistent commitment to politics as usual. Democrat leaders have persuaded themselves (and much of their base) that all the republic needs is a restoration of the status quo ante Trump. They remain oblivious to popular impatience with familiar formulas. Jess King – a Mennonite woman, Bard College MBA and founder of a local non-profit who is running for Congress as a Justice Democrat in Lancaster, Pennsylvania – put it this way: ‘We see a changing political landscape right now that isn’t measured by traditional left to right politics anymore, but bottom to top. In Pennsylvania and many other places around the country we see a grassroots economic populism on the rise, pushing against the political establishment and status quo that have failed so many in our country.’</p>
<p>Democratic insurgents are also developing a populist critique of the imperial hubris that has sponsored multiple failed crusades, extorted disproportionate sacrifice from the working class and provoked support for Trump, who presented himself (however misleadingly) as an opponent of open-ended interventionism. On foreign policy, the insurgents face an even more entrenched opposition than on domestic policy: a bipartisan consensus aflame with outrage at the threat to democracy supposedly posed by Russian hacking. Still, they may have found a tactical way forward, by focusing on the unequal burden borne by the poor and working class in the promotion and maintenance of American empire.</p>
<p>This approach animates <em>Autopsy: The Democratic Party in Crisis,</em> a 33-page document whose authors include Norman Solomon, founder of the web-based insurgent lobby RootsAction.org. ‘The Democratic Party’s claims of fighting for “working families” have been undermined by its refusal to directly challenge corporate power, enabling Trump to masquerade as a champion of the people,’ <em>Autopsy</em> announces. But what sets this apart from most progressive critiques is the cogent connection it makes between domestic class politics and foreign policy. For those in the Rust Belt, military service has often seemed the only escape from the shambles created by neoliberal policies; yet the price of escape has been high. As <em>Autopsy</em> notes, ‘the wisdom of continual war’ – what Clinton calls ‘global leadership’ –</p>

<p class="leftranged">Francis Shen of the University of Minnesota and Douglas Kriner of Boston University analysed election results in three key states – Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan – and found that ‘even controlling in a statistical model for many other alternative explanations, we find that there is a significant and meaningful relationship between a community’s rate of military sacrifice and its support for Trump.’ Clinton’s record of uncritical commitment to military intervention allowed Trump to have it both ways, playing to jingoist resentment while posing as an opponent of protracted and pointless war. Kriner and Shen conclude that Democrats may want to ‘re-examine their foreign policy posture if they hope to erase Trump’s electoral gains among constituencies exhausted and alienated by 15 years of war’. If the insurgent movements within the Democratic Party begin to formulate an intelligent foreign policy critique, a re-examination may finally occur. And the world may come into sharper focus as a place where American power, like American virtue, is limited. For this Democrat, that is an outcome devoutly to be wished. It’s a long shot, but there is something happening out there.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new Stigler Center working paper looks into the effects of referendums and public initiatives on public policy and finds that direct democracy better represents the will of the majority, and therefore might also be better able to counteract the power of special interests over policymaking.</p>
<p>The rise of anti-establishment populist movements in the U.S. and Europe is one of the most remarkable political developments of the last few years. Within the span of a few months in 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union and Americans elected Donald Trump as president, two outcomes that shocked intellectual and political elites.</p>
<p>The global populist rebellion seems to have slowed down a notch in recent months, as far-right candidates Marine Le Pen and Geert Wilders lost elections in France and in the Netherlands, respectively, but the ascent of populist politics nevertheless revealed the extent of voters’ discontent with the status quo and led some scholars to refer to it as a symptom of a crisis of Western liberal democracy.</p>
<p>Much of this has to do with the outsized influence of special interests. In the U.S., the widespread sense that the economic and political systems are “rigged” was a major contributor to the rise of Trump, who repeatedly lambasted the influence of special interests on American politics and vowed to “drain the swamp” in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>But long before Trump, Americans were already losing trust in democratic institutions. According to a Gallup poll from June of last year, Americans’ confidence in institutions is near historical lows at 32 percent, with Congress’s approval rating at an abysmal 9 percent. In a conversation with Stigler Center Director Luigi Zingales in March, Judge Richard Posner described members of Congress as “slave<div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box hundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"  style='background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;'><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row "><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1 fusion-builder-column-4 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last fusion-column-no-min-height 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;'>
					<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"   data-bg-url="">
						[s] to the donors” and said that “[T]he real corruption is the ownership of Congress by the rich.” In a recent interview with ProMarket, Stanford professor Anat Admati listed “political engagement by corporations, including lobbying, campaign contributions, and other tactics that can create confusion and cause policymakers to yield to narrow interests,” as one of the major contributors to public discontent, along with the failure of governments to address inequality and concentration.</p>
<p>As scholars, politicians, and thinkers seek ways to restore public trust, a new Stigler Center working paper points to a possible remedy: more direct democracy.</p>
<p>The paper, written by John G. Matsusaka of the University of Southern California, surveys the extensive literature regarding the effects of referendums and public initiatives on public policy and draws two main conclusions: 1. Contrary to the persistent notion that referendums and other forms of direct democracy lead to chaos, voters actually tend to make reasonable, even conservative choices, especially when it comes to issues like government spending or borrowing; 2. Direct democracy better represents the will of the majority and therefore might also be better able to counteract the power of special interests over policymaking.</p>
<h3>How does direct democracy affect policymaking?</h3>
<p>Direct democracy, as a form of government in which citizens are directly involved in lawmaking instead of delegating it to representatives, goes back at least to ancient Greece. In America, policy decisions were made through town hall meetings since before the founding of the republic, and in Switzerland it has been an essential part of political life since the mid-nineteenth century. In his paper, Matsusaka focuses on the U.S. and Switzerland—the two countries in which direct democracy is most active—and on two forms of direct democracy: referendums, in which citizens vote on policies proposed by government officials; and initiatives, where citizens vote on policies proposed by citizens.</p>
<p>Referendums can be divided into three types: mandatory (a government proposal is required by law to be the subject of a referendum before it goes into effect), petition referendum (a vote on a government proposal that is the result of a citizen petition), and advisory (a referendum that is called at the request of the government, and whose results are not binding in a formal sense, e.g. Brexit). An initiative is a vote that also relies on petitions, but in which citizens vote on policies proposed by the citizens themselves.</p>
<p>In recent years, as governments around the world have struggled with claims that they are overly influenced by special interests, referendums and initiatives have become increasingly popular. Between 2000 and 2010, 298 national referendums were held across the world, with 44 of those taking place in the U.S. and 167 in Europe. All but one of the 50 U.S. states have some form of direct democracy, notes Matsusaka: 30 states require voter approval on debt issues, 49 states require voter approval on constitutional amendments, 23 states allow petition referendums, and 24 states allow initiatives. In November 2016 alone, more than 150 measures appeared in 35 states, as citizens were asked to vote on policies regarding medical marijuana, gun control, health care, minimum wage, and others.</p>
<p>In attempting to estimate the effect of initiatives and referendums on public policy, Matsusaka reviewed numerous theoretical and empirical studies on the connection between initiatives and referendums and policy outcomes. Often, he notes, there is a tendency to describe the findings in the literature as “mixed” or “conflicting” (a characterization he somewhat disagrees with)—and yet, he notes, “some conclusions have been replicated so consistently that it seems safe to treat them as robust patterns.”</p>
<p>One of those patterns is that when voting on specific policies, whether fiscal or social, voters tend to be more conservative than their elected representatives. The evidence, notes Matsusaka, shows that mandatory referendums on new borrowing or spending result in significantly lower levels of both—8 percent lower spending, according to median estimates. “If voter approval is required for spending or debt increases, it is likely that spending and debt will be lower on average,” he writes.</p>
<p>This, he notes, suggests that representative governments tend to spend and borrow more than voters prefer, although he points out that this applies only to recent decades. In the early twentieth century, he writes, the opposite was the case.</p>
<p>The finding that referendums and initiatives tend to lead to more measured fiscal policies is important, because despite its increasing popularity, some still question the viability of direct democracy, arguing that voters are too uninformed, emotional, and susceptible to make decisions regarding specific policies, and that policymaking should remain exclusively in the hands of experts. In the case of Brexit, for instance, the decision by British voters to leave the EU was followed by an instant, widespread rebuke of “irrational,” “ignorant” voters who chose to ignore expert opinions for emotional reasons, to their own detriment.</p>
<p>Another curious finding is that while initiative American states and Swiss cantons have supported lower spending in the last 50 years, initiatives have also driven up spending in cities. This, Matsusaka argues, indicates that officials at the state (and canton) level tend to spend more than voters would like, whereas on the local level politicians tend to spend less than voters would like.</p>
<p>“Sometimes people criticize direct democracy and say that it would lead to anarchy and chaos. The evidence shows that that it absolutely doesn’t do that. There are different outcomes, and you might not like the outcomes, but they’re all reasonable possibilities,” says Matsusaka, the Charles F. Sexton Chair in American Enterprise in the the Marshall School of Business, Gould School of Law, and Department of Political Science at USC. “If people have to approve debt issues, we tend to see less debt issued overall—it’s not like people are irrational and borrow like crazy or entirely choke off borrowing. They are reasonable.”</p>
<h3>Can direct democracy be used to fix democracy?</h3>
<p>Another pattern that Matsusaka identifies is that direct democracy leads to more policies that reflect the views of the majority of the population. The question of whether direct democracy makes policy more congruent with citizen preferences, explains Matsusaka, is central to the literature on the subject, with the debate often divided between two opposing views. On the one hand, there is the “progressive” view, which argues that referendums and initiatives make democracy more responsive to the will of the people. On the other hand, there is the “special interest” view, which argues that direct democracy enhances the influences of special interests, because they have the resources and incentives to dominate elections and ballot measures.</p>
<p>Despite the importance of this debate, he notes, convincing evidence is limited. The existing evidence, however, finds that direct democracy states are indeed more likely to adopt policies favored by a majority of citizens. He quotes from his own 2010 study, which found that in direct democracy states, congruence with majority opinion was 18-19 percent higher than in states without direct democracy. This, he says, is consistent with the view that initiatives allow citizens to counteract the influence of special interests on policies.</p>
<p>Direct democracy, he adds, might be better equipped to withstand the influence of special interests. “You might be able buy legislators, you can give them deals or make arrangements with them. But you can’t make arrangements with 10 or 20 million voters. The most you can do is pour a lot of money into running commercials and try to persuade them, but you can’t corrupt them.You can try to trick and deceive them, but there are limits to how far that can go. If you look at big businesses, most of them don’t like direct democracy. They’d much rather be able work things out with legislators.”</p>
<p>The paper, he says, shows that direct democracy “leads to more majoritarian outcomes. My own personal view is that in a democracy, that’s a good thing. Not in every single case, but in most cases it’s a good thing.”</p>
<p>This, he acknowledges, presents some normative questions which the relevant literature has hardly confronted so far. Democracies often have safeguards in place to limit the ability of the majority to enact certain policies, for instance policies that might discriminate against or otherwise harm minority groups. Initiatives and referendums, he notes, might achieve majoritarian outcomes by overriding these safeguards. “It’s important to keep some the safeguards, like vigilant courts, in place to protect minority rights,” Matsusaka adds.</p>
<p>Despite the criticisms by political elites, however, Matsusaka argues that among voters direct democracy is “tremendously popular.” “There are a lot of surveys in which ordinary citizens were asked who they trust to make decisions, and those surveys routinely show that ordinary citizens trust the people over politicians by a 3-to-1 ratio. It’s always been unpopular with the elites, in my opinion partly because it takes away from their power. But arguments that are made against direct democracy, for instance that people are not informed enough or that turnout is low, are also true when people go to vote for their elected officials. These are really arguments against democracy itself, not direct democracy.”</p>
<p>This week, Matsusaka will visit the Stigler Center for a series of three stand-alone, interrelated lunch seminars that focus on whether direct democracy can be used to fix democracy and counteract the influence of populism. The example he points to is that of the American Progressives of the early twentieth century, like Theodore Roosevelt, who saw initiatives and referendums as a way to make government more responsive.</p>
<p>“People feel they’ve lost control, that someone else has gotten control of the government. Back in the early 20th century, we had a big populist movement. What did they do? They passed the 17th Amendment, which created the direct election of U.S. senators. They passed universal women’s suffrage. They created primary elections so the party’s nominees are chosen by the voters, not by political bosses in smoky back rooms. States also adopted direct democracy in this period as well. In the U.S., the system responded by giving people more control, and that’s what got us over that period, that we made our system more democratic. Direct democracy is a natural way to go when ordinary citizens start to feel it isn’t their government any more.”</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More and more conservatives and liberals, from the halls of Congress to people in communities across the country, are agreeing that the so-called &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; needs serious rethinking.</p>
<p>First, we should define our terms. The &#8220;war on drugs&#8221; that was started by Richard Nixon in 1971 and persists to this day, refers to <em>illegal</em> &#8220;street drugs&#8221; &#8212; cocaine, heroin, marijuana and variations thereof. It is not used to mean a war on <em>legal</em> pharmaceuticals, whose excessive and often inappropriate prescribing takes over 100,000 lives a year in our country. Ironically, prescription opioids alone took 35,000 lives last year &#8212; about equal to traffic fatalities.</p>
<p>The argument to criminalize &#8220;street drugs&#8221;, and severely punish their sellers and users, is largely based on the assumption that a &#8220;tough on crime&#8221; approach will reduce addiction and abuse of these dangerous substances. Criminalizing drug use consistently fails to address the health problems of addiction, and drives the drug trade underground where crime, violence and death flourish.</p>
<p>Our country learned this hard lesson firsthand when it prohibited the production and sale of alcoholic beverages in 1920 through the 18<sup>th </sup>Amendment to the Constitution. That led to an underworld of organized crime and illegal undercover stills making &#8220;moonshine&#8221;, whose victims could hardly go for medical treatment. Considered a failure, the amendment was repealed in 1933 with the 21<sup>st </sup>Amendment.</p>
<p>This national experiment with prohibition verified the wise observation of the famous dean of the Harvard Law School, Roscoe Pound, who said that there were certain human behaviors that are beyond &#8220;the effective limits of legal action.&#8221; In short, the law couldn&#8217;t stop the addicting alcohol business; it could only drive it underground.</p>
<p>Legalizing the sale and possession of alcohol allowed people suffering from alcoholism to come out of the shadows and find support through thousands of successful chapters of Alcoholics Anonymous and other treatment options. Alcoholism is still a problem in our country, but it is out in the open where a rational society can address it.</p>
<p>Nicotine from tobacco products is one of the most addictive drugs that people can ingest. Lawmakers since the days of the Virginia tobacco growers in the 17<sup>th</sup> century have not prohibited the smoking of tobacco. For generations, smoking cigarettes and cigars was not considered harmful; it was said to help concentrate your mind on your tasks. The mass media perpetuated such false statements through ads that claimed doctors preferred Lucky Strikes because they were &#8220;less irritating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the historic and widely reported US Surgeon General&#8217;s Report of 1964 concluded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in men, a probable cause of lung cancer in women and the most important cause of chronic bronchitis. Over time, accumulating scientific knowledge connecting smoking to lung cancer and a host of other diseases began changing habits.</p>
<p>In 1964 about 44% of American adults smoked regularly; now it is down to 17%. Now smokers cannot indulge on airplanes, buses, trains or in schools, waiting rooms and most office buildings. Had we driven tobacco use underground, organized crime would have claimed the tobacco market and smokers and low-level dealers would have been jailed. If alcohol prohibition taught us the limitations of drug criminalization, efforts to reduce tobacco use have shown what is possible when dangerous products are taxed and regulated and consumers are educated.</p>
<p>So, what about &#8220;street drugs?&#8221; The drug trade is tearing Mexico apart. Just in the past few years, over 50,000 people have been slain by the fights between drug cartels and against police, judges, reporters and innocents who just happen to be in the way of the machine guns. Fear, anxiety, outright terror and political corruption grips large regions of our southern neighbor as the cartel&#8217;s violently work to meet the black market demand in the US and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Drug dealers in the US fight each other, producing violent crimes and terrorized neighborhoods.</p>
<p>To suppress this drug trade the US is spending tens of billions of taxpayer dollars a year. Drug cases are clogging our court dockets and crowding out important cases involving corporate crimes and negligence. Low-level drug offenders continue to receive mandatory minimum sentences; filling our prisons and leading to the expansion of the private prison industry whose lobbyists prefer a status quo that commodifies the ruined lives who sustain their profitable inventory.</p>
<p>For decades, conservatives like William F. Buckley and progressives like the then Mayor of Baltimore, Kurt Schmoke, have called for decriminalization, or legalization and regulation, of illegal drugs. We don&#8217;t jail alcoholics for being alcoholics, or incarcerate people for smoking highly addictive cigarettes. Their addictions are treated openly as afflictions to be treated individually and more broadly through sound public policies.</p>
<p>Despite the many calls for reform, the arch-reactionary Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, has recently ordered 5,000 federal assistant US attorneys to charge defendants peddling street drugs, many of whom are addicts themselves, with the most serious crimes and impose the toughest penalties possible.</p>
<p>Not so fast, say a growing group of liberal and conservative members of Congress. From Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) to liberal Patrick Leahy (D-VT), lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are joining together to sponsor a bill to end mandatory minimum sentences. Senator Paul said such sentences &#8220;disproportionately affect minorities and low-income communities&#8221; and will worsen the existing &#8220;injustice&#8221; in the criminal justice system, while Senator Leahy declared that as &#8220;an outgrowth of the failed war on drugs, mandatory sentencing strips criminal public-safety resources away from law-enforcement strategies that actually make our communities safer.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bipartisan bill, S.1127, is already supported by 37 Senators and 79 members of the House. Both the NAACP and the Koch brothers support this legislation!</p>
<p>We need more open debates about the impact of the &#8220;war on drugs.&#8221; As Justice Louis Brandeis said years ago &#8212; &#8220;sunlight is the best disinfectant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saudi and Israel are once again painting Iran as an existential threat to draw the US back to the region. But is that really in America&#8217;s interests?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
<p dir="ltr">President Donald Trump’s visit to the Middle East has turned out as expected: no single act of outreach to the Muslim world could undo his fueling of Islamophobia and no amount of Iranophobia could cover up the irony of Trump and Saudi Arabia uniting against intolerance.</p>
<p dir="ltr">It is clear what Trump wanted from the trip: massive arms sales and Saudi investments in the US economy. But it is less clear why Saudi Arabia and Israel once again depict Iran as an existential threat even after Tehran’s nuclear programme has been checked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The answer lies not in Iran’s regional policy, but Israel and Saudi Arabia’s wish for the US to re-establish hard, American hegemony in the Middle East. That is, for the United States to lead and underwrite the Herculean task of sorting out the chaos in the region. In short: Saudi and Israel first.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Isolating Iran</h3>
<p>A key factor explaining the violence in the Middle East in the past few decades is that the region has lacked a sustainable, indigenous order. The process of establishing an order is by definition disruptive and the Middle East has almost continuously been in this state since the end of the Cold War.</p>
<blockquote><p>While some American allies prefer that the US pays for the security of the region with its blood and treasure, few in Washington ask whether this policy benefits America</p></blockquote>
<p>To make matters worse, the temporary equilibriums that briefly provided a resemblance of order were established and sustained by an external power &#8211; the United States &#8211; rather than by the states of the region themselves. As a result, these temporary periods of stability could only last as long as the external power was willing to sustain the order with its own blood and treasure.</p>
<p>This was certainly the case with Washington’s Dual Containment policy in the mid-1990s. After the end of the Cold War, the United States had the option of establishing a new, inclusive security architecture for the region. Instead, it opted to pursue an order centred on Israel, Egypt and Saudi Arabia while keeping Iran and Iraq in continued isolation.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Iran emerged as the main opponent to the American order as it viewed itself as a regional power that should help lead the region rather than be excluded from its security and political structures.</p>
<p>Iran calculated that the weakest link in the American strategy was the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. If the peace process failed, so would Washington’s efforts to establish an order based on Iran’s prolonged isolation. Iran began to heavily support Palestinian rejectionist groups who used terror against Israel in the hope of collapsing the peace negotiations.</p>

<p>As the US sought to isolate and contain Iran, and thwart its efforts to challenge the US-led order, Washington began portraying Iran as the number one threat to the region’s security, categorising it as a pariah and rogue state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wherever you look, you find the evil hand of Iran in this region,&#8221; Secretary of State Warren Christopher<a href="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/articles-latimes-com-1995-03-13-news-mn-42237-1-conoco-deal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/articles-latimes-com-1995-03-13-news-mn-42237-1-conoco-deal&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1495638270195000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHTirJiXYWm6AQRZc9gMuzQDDqO_w"> said in March 1995</a>, essentially blaming all of the region’s woes on Tehran.</p>
<p>All-out isolation of Iran could not be achieved unless the broader international community began viewing the clerical regime as a rogue actor, which in turn necessitated them buying into the American and Israeli line that Iran was the root cause of all of the region’s ills.</p>
<h3>Isolate Iran, Part II</h3>
<p>Today, even prior to the visit to Saudi Arabia, Trump’s Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had begun echoing Warren Christopher&#8217;s rhetoric on Iran.</p>
<p>“Everywhere you look if there is trouble in the region, you find Iran,” Mattis<a href="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/haaretz-com-israel-news-1-784681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/haaretz-com-israel-news-1-784681&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1495638270195000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHRmOny_R02xFyYg_rS2LPKgkHjjA"> told reporters in Riyadh last week</a>.</p>
<p>Just as Christopher and the Clinton administration’s approach towards Iran in the 1990s<a href="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/amazon-com-treacherous-alliance-secret-dealings-israel-dp-0300143117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/amazon-com-treacherous-alliance-secret-dealings-israel-dp-0300143117&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1495638270195000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG58iJ3PMuNAPQQftnEm12Y6TMukw"> was heavily influenced by Israel</a>, Mattis and the Trump administration appear to be heavily coloured &#8211; if not directed &#8211; by Saudi Arabia.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mattis has even repeated the blatantly false assertion that the only country the Islamic State group hasn&#8217;t attacked is Iran</p></blockquote>
<p>Washington’s talking points on Yemen are now mirror images of Riyadh&#8217;s: the Houthi rebels in Yemen are Iranian proxies rather than independent Yemeni actors, the Yemeni civil war is the result of Iranian meddling rather than the result of a power struggle between various Yemeni factions, and the defeat of the Houthis is necessary to prevent “Iranian hegemony” in the region.</p>
<p>Mattis has even repeated the blatantly false assertion that the only country the Islamic State (IS) group hasn&#8217;t attacked is Iran.</p>

<p>“I consider ISIS nothing more than an excuse for Iran to continue its mischief,” Mattis<a href="https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/politico-com-magazine-story-2016-12-james-mattis-iran-secretary-of-defense-214500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://tracking.cirrusinsight.com/8f9645b2-e7cd-4131-a5a0-b0125347084d/politico-com-magazine-story-2016-12-james-mattis-iran-secretary-of-defense-214500&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1495638270195000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEIVr34EAdyL4RJls9JogPrvnzwwQ"> said in 2015</a>. “Iran is not an enemy of ISIS; they have a lot to gain from the turmoil that ISIS creates…. I would just point out one question for you to look into. What is the one country in the Middle East that has not been attacked by ISIS? One. That is Iran. That is more than happenstance, I’m sure.”</p>

<h3>Music to Saudi and Israeli ears</h3>
<p>Moreover, the Trump administration’s rhetoric increasingly paints Iran &#8211; and not IS &#8211; as the main threat in the region. Some supporters of the Trump administration have long played down the threat from IS, arguing that IS is a short-term problem, while Iran poses a longer term challenge precisely because of its opposition to American hegemony.</p>

<p>But just as Washington’s depiction of Iran as the culprit behind regional instability was widely exaggerated in the 1990s and aimed at masking US frustration with Iranian opposition to the specific regional order Washington preferred, Trump’s desire to blame Iran for the region’s instability and suggest that Iran has a tacit alliance with IS is equally &#8211; if not more &#8211; questionable.</p>
<p>Not because Iran is a constructive player in the Middle East (arguably, only Oman qualifies for that title) or because it hasn’t contributed to the region’s conflicts, but because putting all the blame at the feet of Tehran is simply too convenient.</p>
<p>It is, however, music to Saudi and Israeli ears. Trump dusting off Christopher’s talking points on Iran signals that he’s acquiescing to Saudi and Israeli demands to re-establish American hegemony in the Middle East and revert back to a policy of seeking Iran’s complete isolation.</p>

<h3>Questionable alliance</h3>
<p>For the Saudis, this is more important than scrapping the nuclear deal because in reality it targets the very core of that agreement. The nuclear deal aimed to resolve the nuclear dispute with Iran in order to pave the way for a new, inclusive regional security dialogue &#8211; one that would include Iran. It signalled an end to hard American hegemony and the policy of Iranian isolation. A nightmare, in short, for the Saudis.</p>
<blockquote><p>The nuclear deal signalled an end to hard American hegemony and the policy of Iranian isolation. A nightmare, in short, for the Saudis</p></blockquote>
<p>But while it is understandable that some American allies prefer that the US pays for the security of the region with its blood and treasure, few in Washington ask whether this policy benefits America.</p>
<p>Clearly, the Middle East &#8211; with its vast energy resources &#8211; has been a strategic region for decades. And while the region had strong states, maintaining a balance of power was not too costly. But today, the value of hegemony in the region is questionable. The energy resources are less valuable. And the cost of security has skyrocketed as a result of the collapse of states and societies in the region. On top of that, no state or movement in the region is in a position to challenge the US global position.</p>
<p>Bottom line is: the cost-benefit analysis of hegemony in the Middle East no longer holds up.</p>
<p>But Trump doesn&#8217;t seem to care. As long as he gets the arms sales, he seems indifferent to the cost this questionable alliance with Saudi Arabia will impose on the US in the long run.</p>
<p>It’s an aspect of the art of the deal only he seems to understand and very few question.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h5><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">MEMO TO THE U.S. CONGRESS ON OBAMA GUN-RUNNING TO SYRIA:</span></h5>
<h3><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">It&#8217;s Already Happening</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">by William F. Wertz, Jr.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;"><em>July 1, 2013 (EIRNS)—This release was issued today by the <a href="http://www.larouchepac.com/">Lyndon LaRouche Political Action Committee</a></em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">June 29—<em>Three recent articles published by Reuters (June 18) and the New York Times (June 22 and June 29) now confirm what LaRouche PAC has asserted for months: Contrary to law and without authorization, the Obama Administration has been running guns from Benghazi to Syria, starting several months prior to the terrorist attack on the U.S. mission and CIA annex on Sept. 11, 2012.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;"><em>The guns were being run, and continue to be run, by a cut-out of the February 17th Brigade, a &#8220;former&#8221; member by the name of Abdul Basit Haroun. Haroun is a close associate of the head of the February 17th Brigade Ismael Al-Sallabi and the commander of the February 17th Brigade Fawzi Bukatef, both of whom are quoted in the first two of above-cited articles in defense of Haroun&#8217;s gun-running.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;"><em>The February 17th Brigade, founded by the Emir of the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), Abdelhakim Belhadj, is the militia that was hired by the U.S. to protect the mission in Benghazi. When the attack occurred the February 17th Brigade was nowhere to be found.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;"><em>The most recent New York Times article confirms that Qatar has been shipping weapons to Syria since 2011, including at least one shipment of shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles (MANPADS) from Libya.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;"><em>Prior to these articles, there was already an abundance of evidence strongly suggesting that the Obama administration,under the auspices of John Brennan, had been running guns to the Syrian opposition from Benghazi since at since 2011. We provide that evidence below.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Following President Obama&#8217;s June 16 announcement of his decision to openly provide weapons to the Syrian opposition, several bills have been submitted in the Congress to prevent him from doing so, arguing that such a decision requires the approval of Congress in accordance with the War Powers Resolution and the U.S. Constitution. Legislation introduced by Rep. Walter Jones threatens that to provide weapons thus is an impeachable offense. It has also been reported that a number of Congressional committees have rejected proposals by the Administration to fund the arming of the Syrian opposition with funds already allocated for intelligence purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Yet President Obama has already been providing weapons to the Syrian opposition, including weapons from Libya, in collusion with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the U.A.E., Turkey, and Jordan for over a year. In doing so, he has already committed an impeachable offense in violating the U.S. Constitution. And in the case of weapons shipped to Libya, and from Libya to Syria, he has violated the UN arms embargo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">As perhaps even John Kerry will recall, during the 1980s, when the U.S. Congress cut off funding to the Contras in Nicaragua, Vice President Bush prevailed upon his good friend Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan to secretly fund the Contras. This is the same Prince Bandar who funded the first two 9/11 hijackers to arrive in the U.S. And it is the same Prince Bandar, now Director of Intelligence in Saudi Arabia, who has been arming al-Qaeda in Syria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Obama and his current CIA Director, John Brennan, have been using that same Iran-Contra method, first to illegally arm the al-Qaeda affiliated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group in Libya, headed by Abdelhakim Belhadj, and then to arm the al-Qaeda-dominated opposition in Syria. As the authors of the book <em>Benghazi: The Definitive Report</em> point out, &#8220;From Oliver North to John Brennan, this is just the way that the system works regardless of the administration. The dead bodies they leave in their wake &#8230; are, at the end of the day, just collateral damage in a war waged by those with political ambitions.&#8221;</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The Evidence of Obama&#8217;s Gunrunning</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">On March 7, 2011, the London <em>Independent</em> reported that Obama asked Saudi Arabia to supply arms to the Libyan opposition. He did this <em>despite</em> the fact that the UN Security Council had unanimously imposed an arms embargo to and from Libya on Feb. 26, 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">In addition, in the Spring of 2011, Obama approved the provision of weapons by Qatar and the U.A.E. to the Libyan opposition, according to the <em>New York Times</em> (Dec. 5, 2012). Those weapons did not go to the Libyan Transitional National Council (TNC), but directly to the LIFG, according to an Oct. 17, 2011 <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The UN Panel of Experts confirmed that Qatar and the U.A.E. violated the UN arms embargo, in reports to the President of the Security Council on March 20, 2012, Feb. 15, 2013, and April 9, 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">In respect to Qatar, the UN report states that despite that country&#8217;s denials, &#8220;the Panel stands by its findings that Qatar supplied arms and ammunition to the opposition during the uprising in breach of the arms embargo.&#8221; The report also points to the collusion of NATO in violating the UN-imposed no-fly zone and arms embargo. Citing flights organized by the U.A.E., the report states that the flights &#8220;received deconfliction numbers from NATO, the existence of the no-fly zone and the arms embargo imposed by the Security Council in resolutions 1970 (2011) and 1973 (2011) notwithstanding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The report confirms that, since the overthrow of Qaddafi, &#8220;The Syrian Arab Republic has presented a prominent destination for Libyan fighters. A number of them have joined brigades as individuals or through networks to support the Syrian opposition.&#8221; &#8230; <div class="fusion-fullwidth fullwidth-box hundred-percent-fullwidth non-hundred-percent-height-scrolling"  style='background-color: rgba(255,255,255,0);background-position: center center;background-repeat: no-repeat;padding-top:0px;padding-right:0px;padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:0px;'><div class="fusion-builder-row fusion-row "><div  class="fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion_builder_column_1_1 fusion-builder-column-5 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last fusion-column-no-min-height 1_1"  style='margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;'>
					<div class="fusion-column-wrapper" style="background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;"   data-bg-url="">
						[M]ilitary mat,riel has also been sent out from Libya to the Syrian Arab Republic through networks and routes passing through either Turkey or northern Lebanon&#8230;. Transfers of military mat,riel have been organized from various locations in Libya, including Misrata and Benghazi. The significant size of some shipments and the logistics involved suggest that representatives of the Libyan local authorities might have at least been aware of the transfers, if not actually directly involved.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">During the same month that Qaddafi was assassinated, October 2011, according to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and other sources, Mustafa Abdul Jalil, the head of the Libyan TNC, and Burhan Ghalioun, the head of the Syrian National Council, reached an agreement for military support to the Syrian opposition from Libya. The Emir of the LIFG, Abdelhakim Belhadj, then traveled to Turkey in November 2011 to meet with the Syrian Free Army to provide training and weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">That same month, according to the website Albawaba.com and the truthseeker.co.uk, 600 LIFG terrorists went to Syria to commence military training and operations. They were led by Mahdi al-Harati, deputy commander of the Tripoli Military Council under Belhadj. Then, according to Ahmed Manai, President of the Tunisian Institute of Internatonal Relations, and a member of the Committee on Arab Observers in Syria, on Dec. 11, 2011, an agreement was signed in Tripoli among Jalil, Belhadj, Rashid al-Ghannushi (head of the Muslim Brotherhood in Tunisia), Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Hamad Jabber bin Jassim al-Thani, and the number two of the Muslim Brotherhood in Syria, to provide weapons and fighters to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Stevens Secures MANPADS; Brennan Exports Them</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">According to <em>Benghazi: The Definitive Report</em>, by Brandon Webb and Jack Murphy (New York: William Morrow, February 2013), the operation was run by now-CIA Director John Brennan outside of the traditional command structure, with Obama&#8217;s approval.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The book reports that the United States had been facilitating, or, at the very least allowing, large weapons transfers from Libya to rebel fighters in Syria. The authors maintain that this did not fall under the purview of a Foreign Services officer in the State Department, such as Ambassador Stevens, but rather, &#8220;Stevens likely helped consolidate as many weapons as possible after the war to safeguard them, at which point Brennan exported them overseas to start another conflict.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">On Feb. 2, 2012, Andrew J. Shapiro, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, said in a speech that the United States was engaged in Libya in the most extensive effort to combat the proliferation of man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS) in U.S. history. Libya had acquired 20,000 MANPADS, and, according to Shapiro, only 5,000 could be accounted for as of that date. He further reported that many of the weapons were taken by militias, and that many of the militias remain reluctant to relinquish them. Furthermore, he said that &#8220;we cannot rule out that some weapons may have leaked out of Libya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">In August 2011, the LIFG&#8217;s Belhadj led the takeover of Tripoli, thanks to the backing of Qatar, and became the commander of the Tripoli Military Council, in charge of coordinating defense on a national level, under the TNC. On Sept. 4, 2011, he was appointed to the Supreme Security Council. One week after he was appointed to command the Tripoli Military Council, Belhadj (founder of the February 17th Brigade), Ismael al-Sallabi (head of the February 17th Brigade), and TNC head Jalil went to Qatar, where they met with the financiers of the revolution and NATO officials, according to Kronos Advisory, LLC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">On Sept. 27, 2011, ABC News reported that Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch had taken pictures in Libya of pickup truckloads of missiles being carted off by the Libya opposition. He said: &#8220;I myself could have removed several hundred if I wanted to, and people can literally drive up with pickup trucks or even 18 wheelers and take away whatever they want. Every time I arrive at one of these weapons facilities, the first thing we notice going missing is the surface-to-air missiles.&#8221; Richard Clark, former White House counterterrorism advisor and now a consultant to ABC News, said, &#8220;I think the probability of al-Qaeda being able to smuggle some of the Stinger-like missiles out of Libya is probably pretty high.&#8221;</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">UN Panel of Experts Documents Two Shipments</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">On April 27, 2012, according to the UN Panel of Experts report, Lebanese authorities seized a shipment of arms and ammunition destined for the opposition forces in the Syrian Arab Republic. The Panel inspected the shipment and concluded that &#8220;the shipment consisted of Libyan arms and ammunition that were transferred to the Luftfallah II in breach of the arms embargo.&#8221; The shipment included &#8220;SA-24 short range surface-to-air missiles and SA-7b manportable air defense systems, anti-tank guided missiles,&#8221; etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Yet already on Sept. 14, 2012, three days after Stevens was killed, the <em>Times</em> of London reported that a Libyan ship carrying weapons, including SAM-73 surface-to-air anti-aircraft missiles and rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) for the Syrian opposition, had docked in Turkey. The UN has confirmed that the ship was the <em>al-Entisar</em>. It sailed from Benghazi to Iskenderun, Turkey, where it docked on Aug. 25, 2012, returning to Benghazi on Sept. 3.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Both of these documented shipments to Syria from Libya, and undoubtedly others, occurred after Obama reportedly signed a secret order authorizing the CIA to help coordinate the shipment of weapons by Saudi Arabia and Qatar to the Syrian opposition (See below).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">So, on the one hand, beginning in August 2011, the U.S. and U.K. were reportedly trying to secure the MANPADS in Libya; but on the other, the Obama Administration, which approved the illegal provision of weapons by Qatar and the U.A.E. to the LIFG, had enlisted those allies to provide arms and jihadists in the effort to overthrow Assad.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Obama Signs &#8220;Finding;&#8221; Involvement of Senior White House Officials</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Sometime in early 2012, or perhaps earlier, Obama signed a &#8220;finding&#8221; that permitted the CIA and other U.S. agencies to provide support to the Syrian opposition, Reuters reported on Aug. 1, 2012. The news agency added that the U.S. was collaborating with a secret command center operated by Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar near the Syrian border, in Adana, Turkey, which is five miles east of Incirlik, a U.S. air base where U.S. military and intelligence agencies maintain a presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The arms airlift expanded after the November Presidential elections, according to the <em>New York Times</em> of March 24, 2013 (&#8220;Arms Airlift to Syria Rebels Expands, with Aid from CIA&#8221;): &#8220;More than 160 military cargo flights by Jordanian, Saudi and Qatari military-style cargo planes land[ed] at Esenboga Airport near Ankara, and, to a lesser degree, at other Turkish and Jordanian airports.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The CIA has been directly involved in this operation, the <em>Times</em> reported: &#8220;From offices at secret locations, American intelligence officers have helped the Arab governments shop for weapons, including a large procurement from Croatia.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">&#8220;Qatar and Saudi Arabia had been shipping military materials via Turkey to the opposition since early and late 2012. Simultaneously, arms and equipment were being purchased by Saudi Arabia in Croatia and flown to Jordan on Jordanian cargo planes for rebels working in southern Syria and for retransfer to Turkey for rebels groups operating from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">&#8220;On a string of nights from April 26 through May 4 [2012], a Qatari Air Force C-17a huge American-made cargo plane made six landings in Turkey, at Esenboga Airport. By Aug. 8 the Qataris had made 14 more cargo flights. All came from Al Udeid Air Base 4 in Qatar, a hub for American military logistics in the Middle East.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">&#8220;American officials have confirmed that senior White House officials were regularly briefed on the shipments.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">&#8220;Through the fall [of 2012], the Qatari Air Force cargo fleet became even more busy, running flights almost every other day in October&#8230;. Soon other players joined the airlift: In November, three Royal Jordanian Air Force C-130s landed in Esenboga, in a hint at what would become a stepped-up Jordanian and Saudi role. Within three weeks, two other Jordanian cargo planes began making a round-trip run between Amman, the capital of Jordan, and Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, where &#8230; the aircraft were picking up a large Saudi purchase of infantry arms from a Croatian-controlled stockpile.&#8221;</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The Jordanian planes bore the logo of the Jordanian International Air Cargo firm, which, the article reports, is a front company for Jordan&#8217;s Air Force.</span></p>
<h5><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">A Gun-Runner Confesses</span></h5>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">On June 18, 2013 Reuters published an interview with Abdul Basit Haroun (&#8220;Adventures of a Libyan Weapons Dealer in Syria&#8221;) in which he admitted that he is involved in shipping weapons from Benghazi, Libya to Syria. Haroun said that his first shipment of weapons to Syria was successfully delivered aboard the Entisar in August 2012. An earlier shipment on the Luftfallah II was intercepted on April 27, 2012 by Lebanese authorities. According to Haroun, he now delivers weapons to Syria on chartered flights to neighboring countries, and then smuggles them over the border to Syria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">On June 22, the <em>New York Times</em> published an article entitled &#8220;In Turnabout, Syria Rebels Get Libyan Weapons&#8221; that reports that the chartered flights are being financed and provided by Qatar: &#8220;Many of the same people who chased [Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi] to his grave are busy shuttling his former arms stockpiles to rebels in Syria&#8230;. Evidence gathered in Syria, along with flight-control data and interviews with militia members, smugglers, rebels, analysts and officials in several countries, offers a profile of a complex and active multinational effort, financed largely by Qatar, to transport arms from Libya to Syria&#8217;s opposition fighters.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The Reuters article then quotes Ismail al-Sallabi, the head of the Feb. 17th Brigade, who says: &#8220;Abdel Basit Haroun was with us in the February 17 brigade before he quit to form his own brigade.&#8221; Haroun said that he can collect weapons from around Libya and arrange for them to be delivered to the Syrian rebels because of his contacts in Libya and abroad. &#8220;They know we are sending guns to Syria. Everyone knows.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">According to the article, Haroun runs his operation with an associate, who helps him coordinate about a dozen people in Libyan cities collecting the weapons. Both said several flights had been chartered to Jordan or Turkey to deliver the weapons. Haroun&#8217;s associate runs a relief organization, the Libyan National Council for Relief and Support. Haroun said he had no control over which groups received the weapons. However, both he and his associate traveled with their first successful delivery in August 2012 over the Syrian border, to ensure it reached its destination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The <em>New York Times</em> quotes Fawzi Bukatef, who was the commander of the February 17th Brigade in Benghazi, that the Libyan militias have been shipping weapons to Syrian rebels for more than a year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">The article also states that the weapons are sent on ships or Qatar Emiri Air Force flights to a network of intelligence agenices and Syrian oppostion leaders in Turkey. Qatari C-17 cargo aircraft have made at least three documented stops in Libya this year, the <em>Times</em> writes, including flights from Mitiga airport in Tripoli on Jan. 15 and Feb. 1 and another that departed Benghazi on April 16. The planes returned to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The cargo was then flown to Ankara, Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Al Udeid Air Base, as of 2010, was the home of 10,000 U.S. personnel and 100 Qataris.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Another article in the <em>New York Times</em> on June 29 entitled &#8220;Taking Outsize Role in Syria, Qatar Funnels Arms to Rebels,&#8221; further confirms that Qatar has been shipping arms to the Syrian rebels since 2011. &#8220;Qatar&#8217;s covert efforts to back the Syrian rebels began at the same time that it was increasing its support for opposition fighters in Libya.&#8221; The article further confirms that &#8220;a shipment of Eastern bloc missiles [MANPADS] had come from former Qaddafi stockpiles.&#8221;</span><div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">May 1, 2017 (EIRNS)—A bi-partisan group of nine Senators sent a letter to Saudi Ambassador in Washington Khalid bin Salman Abdulaziz, last Thursday, calling on the Saudi kingdom to cease bombing the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah, the single port capable of receiving foreign aid for the war-battered population. Today, there are signs that the pressure may be succeeding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Led by Indiana Republican Senator Todd Young, the group also includes Senators Chris Murphy (D-CT), John Boozman (R-AR), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Christopher Coons (D-DL) and Ed Markey (D-MA). The letter outlines five points to &#8220;alleviate the suffering&#8221; of the Yemeni people, leading with lending &#8220;full support to Secretary Mattis’ call for a political settlement in Yemen.&#8221; In addition, they call upon the Saudis to &#8220;refrain from bombing&#8221; the port; expedite the inspection process for food cargos; facilitate the delivery of cargo cranes; and to &#8220;redouble efforts to ensure airstrikes do not hit key economic facilities and civilian infrastructure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Last week, the UN hosted a &#8220;Pledge Conference&#8221; which raised over $1 billion in food aid—unfortunately, only half of the $2.1 billion they were seeking. On Friday, following the second direct visit of Defense Secretary James Mattis to the kingdom, it was reported by Al-Monitor that the Saudis had apparently &#8220;shifted&#8221; their approach to Yemen, and were now looking for a &#8220;political solution&#8221; to the fighting. The paper quotes former (Obama-era) ambassador Gerald Feierstein, that this move could have significance far beyond the Gulf region: </span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">&#8220;Most importantly, if you can get some kind of political agreement on Hodeidah, it might in turn be a confidence-building measure that allows you to accomplish other things, that allows you to move on to getting back to political negotiations,&#8221; </span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">Feierstein said. &#8220;So it could be a real game changer if you can get this done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular;">It should be recalled that, in April, Gen. Mattis—in what amounted to a complete reversal of what he had said only a month earlier—had called for a political solution in Yemen, saying that, &#8220;our goal is to push this conflict into U.N.-brokered negotiations to make sure it is ended as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
