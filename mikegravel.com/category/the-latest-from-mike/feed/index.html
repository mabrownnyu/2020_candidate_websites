								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rule of law is central to human governance. It is incumbent on those citizens who make the laws and those citizens who enjoy or suffer the consequences of laws to realize that lawmaking is the fundamental exercise of human self-governance. Its importance dictates that lawmaking be done deliberately and fully informs the constituents in the course of the lawmaking process.</p>
<p>The Legislative Procedures Act addresses this all-important issue: deliberative lawmaking. Below I analyze in detail the procedures and their relevance to the legislative process. What is self evident will not be commented uponThe text of the Act is in new times roman my comments and analysis are in Cambria. The Act is left justified while the comments are justified.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THE CITIZENS LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES ACT</p>
<p>An Act establishing legislative procedures and a Citizens Trust to administer the legislative procedures herein on behalf of the Legislature of the People so that individual citizens can deliberatively exercise their legislative powers; and adding to the Federal Code.</p>
<p>Be It Enacted By The Citizens Of The United States:</p>
<h1><a id="post-1443-__RefHeading__1146_1467228087"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc252225464"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc408491818"></a>Section 1. TITLE</h1>
<p>This act shall be known and may be cited as the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act.</p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>The title and summary followed by Section1 emulate the format of bills in Congress.</h1>
<h1>Section 2. PREAMBLE</h1>
<p>We, the People of the United States, inherently possess the sovereign authority and power to govern ourselves. We asserted this power in our Declaration of Independence and in the ratification of our Constitution. We, the People, choose to participate as lawmakers in all government jurisdictions.</p>
<p>THEREFORE, We, the People, sanction the election conducted by the Philadelphia II organization and establish the number of votes necessary to ratify the Citizens Amendment and enact the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act as the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election, permitting Citizens to exercise their lawmaking powers, concurrent with the legislative powers we delegate to our elected representatives in all government jurisdictions.</p>
<p>AND THEREFORE, We, the People, enact this Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, to provide for the administration of the “Legislature of the People.”</p>
<p>The preamble is an important legislative element in that it defines the goal of the legislation and summaries its major elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><a id="post-1443-__RefHeading__1150_1467228087"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc252225466"></a><a id="post-1443-_Toc408491820"></a>Section 3. LEGISLATIVE PROCEDURES</h1>
<p>The Citizens Trust (hereinafter “Trust”) shall qualify proposed legislation chronologically, limiting one initiative per week for each government jurisdiction. The Trust shall take advantage of contemporary technology in implementing these procedures so as to facilitate as much as possible the citizens’ legislative role. The essential elements of the legislative process include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>In the Congress the leader in each house determines when and if legislation will be taken up; something very partisan and unfair. Under the Act’s procedures no such tyranny is possible in that all legislation when qualified will be taken up chronologically; An improvement over Congress. The amount of time a citizen will be able to vote on issues is twenty-four hours a day for one week. Voters can be any where in the world and vote via the Internet. This voting procedure discredits the canard that the People’s legislature will be flooded with thousands bills. Acting on legislation will be limited to 52 weeks no such flood can take place. Citizens will be able to vote at the same time on 52 national issues, 52 state issues and 52 local issues.</p>
<p>A. Sponsors.</p>
<p>Only citizens of the United States who are natural persons registered to vote may introduce or sponsor legislation. The authors and sponsors shall be identified on the proposed legislation, on any qualifying petition, and on any qualifying poll. The Trust may grant special chronological consideration to legislation introduced by the President or by the directors of Philadelphia II.</p>
<p>B. Form.</p>
<p>Legislation shall comprise a Title, a Summary, a Preamble that states the subject and purposes of the legislation, and its complete text.</p>
<p>C. Content.</p>
<p>The legislation shall pertain to matters of public policy relevant to the government jurisdiction to which it is applicable. The Sponsors shall determine the wording of the Title and Summary subject to approval by the Trust.</p>
<p>D. Subject.</p>
<p>An initiative shall address only one subject but may include related or mutually dependent parts.</p>
<p>E. Word Limit.</p>
<p>An initiative shall contain no more than five thousand words, exclusive of the Title, Preamble, Summary, references, definitions and language that quotes existing law.</p>
<p>Items D and E are subject to a great deal of abuse in Congress and in state legislatures. If you can pack several issues into one piece of legislation you have the opportunity to sneak into enactment bad stuff. The unlimited length of legislation, sometimes hundred of pages also offers the opportunity for corruption. The Patriot Act of 9/11 is a great example. The five thousand-word-limit is a reasonable length to explain a single subject. Correcting these legislative abuses guarantees greater transparency to the process.</p>
<p>F. Qualification.</p>
<p>Following approval of the Title and Summary by the Trust, the proposed legislation may qualify for election in the relevant government jurisdiction when the subject matter described in the title and summary is approved by forty percent of respondents in a public opinion poll. To qualify, the polling plan, including the number of respondents, the methodology and the entity that will conduct the poll, shall be approved in advance by the Trust.</p>
<p>The theory behind requiring a poll is to make sure that there is broad interest in the subject matter beyond that of the sponsors. The threshold is 40 percent of the constituency must be willing to address the subject. This has the effect of limiting self-serving and crazy legislation. Polling is sophisticated and accurate.</p>
<p>G. Communications.</p>
<p>Once an initiative is qualified, the title, summary, preamble, text and the identity of its sponsors shall be published on an Internet website and in various mediums of communication. Additional information: the Hearing Record; the Deliberative Committee report; the result of the Legislative Advisory Vote; statements prepared by the Sponsors, other proponents and opponents; and a balanced analysis prepared by the Trust of the pros and cons of the initiative, including its costs and benefits and societal, environmental, and economic implications, shall be added to the publications on the legislation’s web page as this information becomes available. Here again the goal is total and continuous transparency.</p>
<p>The level of communications in the Legislative Procedures far exceeds that of Congress and state legislatures. Initially setting up a web site for each qualified proposed law provides a vehicle where the resulting steps in the legislative process are communicated to the public as they occur. Holding hearings on legislation is similar to that of all legislative bodies. In this case, however, the hearings will be compelled to be implement by the newest technology some of which has yet to be developed.</p>
<p>H. Public Hearing.</p>
<p>After an initiative qualifies for election, the Trust shall appoint a Hearing Officer to conduct a public hearing. Representatives of the initiative’s Sponsors and representatives of the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction shall participate in the hearing in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Trust. Testimony on the proposed law by proponents, opponents and experts shall be solicited, and their testimonies shall be published as the Hearing Record.</p>
<p>I. Deliberative Committee.</p>
<p>After the public hearings the Trust shall convene a Deliberative Committee demographically representing the government jurisdiction to review each initiative. The Deliberative Committee shall be drawn at random from a pool of citizens previously developed and maintained by the Trust. Each member of the Deliberative Committee shall be fairly compensated for time spent and expenses incurred in performance of Committee duties. The Trust shall provide technical support and such additional resources as are necessary for the effective discharge of the Committee&#8217;s duties. The Deliberative Committee shall review the Hearing Record, secure expert advice, deliberate the merits of the initiative, and prepare a written report of its deliberations and recommendations. By two-thirds vote, the Deliberative Committee may alter the Title, Summary, Preamble or text of the initiative, provided that the changes are consistent with the stated purposes of the initiative.</p>
<p>Existing legislatures operate under a committee system where proposed bills are referred after first reading (introduction). Committees give the legislation the needed scrutiny to determine if it is worthy of enactment after which it is referred to the full legislative body for a vote. This committee process to is vital to the deliberative process. It is not entirely replicable in the Legislature of the People. However, a Deliberative Committee is specifically designed to capture all of the elements of a committee system and then some.</p>
<p>J. Legislative Advisory Vote.</p>
<p>Each initiative, together with its Hearing Record and report of the Deliberative Committee, shall be transmitted to the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction. The legislative body shall conduct a public vote of its members, recording the yeas and nays on the initiative, within 90 days after receipt thereof. The vote of the legislative body is non-binding, serving only as an advisory to the citizens.</p>
<p>This vote is unique to the Legislature of the People. It is based on the fact that full time representatives in legislatures have special knowledge about the issues affecting their constituencies. That being the case it makes sense to avail ourselves of that knowledge via a public advisory vote on the proposed legislation under consideration. This is a mandatory requirement on government representatives and is the only area where the enactment of the Legislature of the People impinges on the independence of representative government’s legislative bodies. This information, published in the legislation web site, serves as an informative cue to the general public before a final vote is taken.</p>
<p>K. Promotional Communications.</p>
<p>Any communication, regardless of the medium through which conveyed, that promotes or opposes an initiative shall conspicuously identify the person(s) responsible for that communication, in a manner specified by the Trust.</p>
<p>L. Campaign Financing.</p>
<p>Only United States citizens may contribute funds, services or property in support of or in opposition to an initiative. Contributions from corporations including, but not limited to, such incorporated entities as industry groups, labor unions, political parties, political action committees, organized religious bodies and associations are specifically prohibited. Such entities are also prohibited from coercing or inducing employees, clients, customers, members, or any other associated persons to support or oppose an initiative. Violation of these prohibitions is a felony punishable by not more than one year in prison, or a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars, or both, per instance, applied to each person found guilty of the violation.</p>
<p>M. Financial Disclosure.</p>
<p>The Trust shall establish financial reporting requirements applicable to initiative sponsors, proponents and opponents. The Trust shall make all financial reports available to the public immediately upon its receipt thereof. Failure of sponsors, proponents or opponents to comply with these reporting requirements shall be a felony punishable by not more than one year in prison or a fine not to exceed One Hundred Thousand Dollars, or both, per instance, applied to each person found guilty of the violation.</p>
<p>N. Election.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the Legislative Advisory Vote, or 90 days after the initiative has been delivered to the legislative body of the relevant government jurisdiction for an advisory vote, whichever occurs first, the Trust shall publish a schedule for the election of the proposed bill and shall conduct an election in accordance with the published schedule. The Trust shall conduct all initiative elections employing the most effective and secure technology. The Trust shall administer an election that is available to the constituency in question for twenty-four hours a day for seven days. The Trust shall make voting on proposed legislation as convenient as possible using the newest secure technology.</p>
<p>This election process is considerably superior to existing elections held by representative governments, which suffer from extensive voter suppression. After the enactment of the Citizens Amendment and the accompanying Act, the role of voters participating in the election conducted by the Philadelphia II shall be turned over to the Citizens Trust as a foundation of it to set up a process where every voter in the United States is registered for life. The Citizens Trust will conduct every initiative election at every level of government. This will require the national disbursements of Trust offices across the nation. I anticipate that this electoral process will be so efficient and fair that the public will clamor that the Trust conduct all elections for representative government.</p>
<p>O. Enactment.</p>
<p>An initiative that creates or modifies a constitution or charter becomes law when it is approved by more than one-half the registered voters <a id="post-1443-__DdeLink__1161_1467228087"></a>of the relevant government jurisdiction in each of two successive elections. If the amendment is approved in the first election, a second ratification election shall occur no earlier than six months and no later than a year after the first election. An initiative that enacts, modifies or repeals a statute becomes the law when approved by more than half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction who participate in the election.</p>
<p>P. Effective Date.</p>
<p>The effective date of an initiative, if not otherwise specified in the initiative, shall be forty-five days after certification of its enactment by the Trust.</p>
<p>Q. Judicial Review.</p>
<p>No court shall have the power to enjoin any election within the Legislature of the People except on grounds of fraud. After an initiative or proposed bill has been enacted into law, courts, when requested, may determine the constitutionality of the law.</p>
<p>R. Withdrawal.</p>
<p>The Sponsors of an initiative may withdraw an initiative from further consideration and processing at any time prior to a deadline established by the Trust.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Section 1.   The sovereign authority of the People of the United States, vested in an independent "Legislature of the People" wherein individual citizens can exercise their legislative power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions via local, state and national legislation, shall not be denied or abridged by any federal, state]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Section 1</strong>.   The sovereign authority of the People of the United States, vested in an independent &#8220;Legislature of the People&#8221; wherein individual citizens can exercise their legislative power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions via local, state and national legislation, shall not be denied or abridged by any federal, state or local government of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>The technology today permits us to simply asks the American people via a national election if they wish to create a “Legislature of the People” wherein they as individual citizens will be able to make laws, amend constitutions and charters in a deliberative process based on the legislative procedures enacted in companion legislation: Legislative Procedures Act.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 2.  </strong> The citizens of the United States hereby sanction the national election conducted by the Philadelphia II organization and hereby establish the number of votes necessary to ratify this Citizens Amendment, and enact the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, as the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Opposition to creating a Legislature of the People will question the legitimacy of the Philadelphia II national election that permits citizens to vote on such an enactment because there is no reference of this power in the Constitution.  Article VII, the creation part of the Constitution, was legally in violation of the Confederate Constitution, which mandated that any change must be by unanimous agreement thereby making the Philadelphia Constitution on its surface illegal. Article. VII “The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.” This article created our present government. It was made legal by the acceptance of the leaders in state governments of the Confederacy. Once the nine states acted under the dictates of Article VII, three additional states followed within the year. The political leaders opposed to the Philadelphia Constitution could have continued their opposition –– their case being legally superior to the Article VII process. However, that’s not what happened. Opposition faded away in the short course of time. In fact, elite opponents just caved in. They knew the Confederation was unraveling putting their political power and their property interests at risk. The opponents of the Philadelphia II election should expect the same melting away since they would find themselves in opposition to 70 to 80 million or more citizens who consciously voted to empower themselves by creating a “Legislature of the People.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 3.</strong>   A Citizens Trust is hereby created to administer the legislative procedures created by the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act and to conduct elections of proposed legislation at all levels of government. A Board of Trustees and a Director shall govern the Citizens Trust. The Citizens Legislative Procedures Act defines the composition of the Board of Trustees and their election, their duties and responsibilities; and the duties, responsibilities and the selection process of the Director.</p>
<p><strong>All legislative bodies require an agency to manage the conduct of administrative services for the smooth operation of the legislative body. The agency in question conducts the research and the management of parliamentary procedures during the course of legislative debates and the bill’s enactment. The Agency is responsible for the enrollment of bills and the management of their progress through the deliberative legislative process.  The agency is also responsibly to secure and manage all of the recourses and supplies required for the operation of the legislatures. The U.S. Senate Secretary fulfills these legislative responsibilities. The same requirement exists for the smooth operation of the People’s Legislature and to address the administrative and physical resource needs of the people now acting as legislative lawmakers. In addition to the normal operations of a legislative body the people’s Trust must conduct national, state and local elections every calendar week. Citizen voters will have one week 24 hours a day to vote on legislation dealing with issues germane to the federal, state or local levels of government. The effect of this voting pattern is to limit action on initiative bills at each level of government to 52 per year. Legislation not taken up in the year of its introduction is held over to be processed chronologically in subsequent years. The Trust is responsible for registering all eligible voters for life. A Citizens Trust is herein created to administer and manages the legislative procedures enacted by the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act. The Act addresses in great detail all of the procedures for the smooth operation of the people’s legislature. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 4.</strong>   Legislation created under the authority of this Amendment that amends the Constitution of the United States or the constitution of any state, or the charter of any local government, becomes law when approved by more than one-half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction in each of two successive elections. If the amendment is approved in the first election, a second ratification election shall occur no earlier than six months and no later than a year after the first election. An initiative that enacts, modifies or repeals a statute becomes law when approved by more than one-half the registered voters of the relevant government jurisdiction who participate in the election.</p>
<p><strong>The standard to amend constitutions and charters is purposely made difficult because these amendments are to the foundational documents creating government entities.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 5.</strong></p>
<p>An appropriation is hereby authorized from the Treasury of the United States to fund the initial and subsequent annual costs of operating the Legislature of the People and the Citizens Trust to meet its responsibilities defined in the Legislative Procedures Act. The sum appropriated shall equal the sum appropriated to fund the annual operations of Congress.</p>
<p><strong>The appropriation process originates in the House of Representatives. It would be a simple task for elites to pressure the members of the House to deny the funds necessary for the operation of Legislature of the People. Suing the House to act will throw the issue to the Supreme Court playing into the hands of elites. By appropriating the necessary funds in a constitutional amendment we avoid an imbroglio with the House and the Supreme Court. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 6.</strong></p>
<p>Only natural persons who are citizens of the United States may introduce legislation, contribute funds, services or property in support or in opposition to initiatives in the Legislature of the People.</p>
<p><strong>One of the most corrupting elements of our capitalistic society is the legal treatment –– established by the Supreme Court –– of corporations as natural persons investing the corporate entity with the power of free speech thereby introducing the wealth of corporations, under the direct control of elites, to further control governments and society. This corruption is denied access to the legislative process of the Legislature of the People by including its prohibition in this amendment.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 7.</strong></p>
<p>Citizens shall have the power to enforce the provisions of this Amendment and the Citizens Legislative Procedures Act. No United States court may enjoin an initiative election except on grounds of fraud.</p>
<p><strong>This section is boilerplate articulated in a number of amendments to the Constitution. It reinforces the sovereign power of the people to defend and enforce the enactment of the Citizens Amendment and the Legislative Procedures Act herein enacted.</strong></p>
<p><strong>CITIZENS AMENDMENT to the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED STATES</strong></p>
<p><strong>Section 1</strong>.   The sovereign authority of the People of the United States, vested in an independent &#8220;Legislature of the People&#8221; wherein individual citizens can exercise their legislative power to enact, repeal and amend public policies, laws, charters and constitutions via local, state and national initiatives, shall not be denied or abridged by any federal, state or local government of the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Section 2.  </strong> The citizens of the United States hereby sanction the national election conducted by the Philadelphia II organization and hereby establish the number of votes necessary to ratify this Citizens Amendment, and enact the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act, as the majority of votes cast in the most recent presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Section 3.</strong>   A Citizens Trust is hereby created to administer the legislative procedures created by the accompanying Citizens Legislative Procedures Act and to conduct elections of proposed legislation at all levels of government.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Special Report:</strong> In the Watergate era, liberals warned about U.S. intelligence agencies manipulating U.S. politics, but now Trump-hatred has blinded many of them to this danger becoming real, as ex-CIA analyst Ray McGovern notes.</p>
<p>By Ray McGovern</p>
<p>Russia-gate is becoming FBI-gate, thanks to the official release of unguarded text messages between loose-lipped FBI counterintelligence official Peter Strzok and his garrulous girlfriend, FBI lawyer Lisa Page. (Ten illustrative texts from their exchange appear at the end of this article.)</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">
</div>
<p>Despite his former job as chief of the FBI’s counterintelligence section, Strzok had the naive notion that texting on FBI phones could not be traced. Strzok must have slept through “Security 101.” Or perhaps he was busy texting during that class. Girlfriend Page cannot be happy at being misled by his assurance that using office phones would be a secure way to conduct their affair(s).</p>
<p>It would have been unfortunate enough for Strzok and Page to have their adolescent-sounding texts merely exposed, revealing the reckless abandon of star-crossed lovers hiding (they thought) secrets from cuckolded spouses, office colleagues, and the rest of us. However, for the never-Trump plotters in the FBI, the official release of just a fraction (375) of almost 10,000 messages does incalculably more damage than that.</p>
<p>We suddenly have documentary proof that key elements of the U.S. intelligence community were trying to short-circuit the U.S. democratic process. And that puts in a new and dark context the year-long promotion of Russia-gate. It now appears that it was not the Russians trying to rig the outcome of the U.S. election, but leading officials of the U.S. intelligence community, shadowy characters sometimes called the Deep State.</p>
<p>More of the Strzok-Page texting dialogue is expected to be released. And the Department of Justice Inspector General reportedly has additional damaging texts from others on the team that Special Counsel Robert Mueller selected to help him investigate Russia-gate.</p>
<p>Besides forcing the removal of Strzok and Page, the text exposures also sounded the death knell for the career of FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, in whose office some of the plotting took place and who has already announced his plans to retire soon.</p>
<p>But the main casualty is the FBI’s 18-month campaign to sabotage candidate-and-now-President Donald Trump by using the Obama administration’s Russia-gate intelligence “assessment,” electronic surveillance of dubious legality, and a salacious dossier that could never pass the smell test, while at the same time using equally dubious techniques to immunize Hillary Clinton and her closest advisers from crimes that include lying to the FBI and endangering secrets.</p>
<p>Ironically, the Strzok-Page texts provide something that the Russia-gate investigation has been sorely lacking: first-hand evidence of both corrupt intent and action. After months of breathless searching for “evidence” of Russian-Trump collusion designed to put Trump in the White House, what now exists is actual evidence that senior officials of the Obama administration colluded to keep Trump out of the White House – proof of what old-time gumshoes used to call “means, motive and opportunity.”</p>
<p>Even more unfortunately for Russia-gate enthusiasts, the FBI lovers’ correspondence provides factual evidence exposing much of the made-up “Resistance” narrative – the contrived storyline that <em>The New York Times</em> and much of the rest of the U.S. mainstream media deemed fit to print with little skepticism and few if any caveats, a scenario about brilliantly devious Russians that not only lacks actual evidence – relying on unverified hearsay and rumor – but doesn’t make sense on its face.</p>
<p>The Russia-gate narrative always hinged on the preposterous notion that Russian President Vladimir Putin foresaw years ago what no American political analyst considered even possible, the political ascendancy of Donald Trump. According to the narrative, the fortune-telling Putin then risked creating even worse tensions with a nuclear-armed America that would – by all odds – have been led by a vengeful President Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Besides this wildly improbable storyline, there were flat denials from WikiLeaks, which distributed the supposedly “hacked” Democratic emails, that the information came from Russia – and there was the curious inability of the National Security Agency to use its immense powers to supply any technical evidence to support the Russia-hack scenario.</p>
<p><strong>The Trump Shock</strong></p>
<p>But the shock of Trump’s election and the decision of many never-Trumpers to cast their lot with the Resistance led to a situation in which any prudent skepticism or demand for evidence was swept aside.</p>

<p>So, on Jan. 6, 2017, President Obama’s Director of National Intelligence James Clapper released an evidence-free report that he said was compiled by “hand-picked” analysts from the CIA, FBI and NSA, offering an “assessment” that Russia and President Putin were behind the release of the Democratic emails in a plot to help Trump win the presidency.</p>
<p>Despite the extraordinary gravity of the charge, even New York Times correspondent Scott Shane noted that proof was lacking. He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/us/politics/russian-hacking-election-intelligence.html?mcubz=3">wrote</a> at the time: “What is missing from the <div class="fusion-clearfix"></div>

						[the Jan. 6] public report is what many Americans most eagerly anticipated: hard evidence to back up the agencies’ claims that the Russian government engineered the election attack. … Instead, the message from the agencies essentially amounts to ‘trust us.’”</p>
<p>But the “assessment” served a useful purpose for the never-Trumpers: it applied an official imprimatur on the case for delegitimizing Trump’s election and even raised the long-shot hope that the Electoral College might reverse the outcome and possibly install a compromise candidate, such as former Secretary of State Colin Powell, in the White House. Though the Powell ploy fizzled, the hope of somehow removing Trump from office continued to bubble, fueled by the growing hysteria around Russia-gate.</p>
<p>Virtually all skepticism about the evidence-free “assessment” was banned. For months, the Times and other newspapers of record repeated the lie that all 17 U.S. intelligence agencies had concurred in the conclusion about the Russian “hack.” Even when that <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/06/29/nyt-finally-retracts-russia-gate-canard/">falsehood was belatedly acknowledged</a>, the major news outlets just shifted the phrasing slightly to say that U.S. intelligence agencies had reached the Russian “hack” conclusion. Shane’s blunt initial recognition about the lack of proof disappeared from the mainstream media’s approved narrative of Russia-gate.</p>
<p>Doubts about the Russian “hack” or dissident suggestions that what we were <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/05/13/the-soft-coup-of-russia-gate/">witnessing was a “soft coup”</a> were scoffed at by leading media commentators. Other warnings from veteran U.S. intelligence professionals about <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/20/more-holes-in-russia-gate-narrative/">the weaknesses of the Russia-gate</a> narrative and the danger of letting politicized intelligence overturn a constitutional election were also brushed aside in pursuit of the goal of removing Trump from the White House.</p>
<p>It didn’t even seem to matter when new <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/12/05/the-tangled-threads-of-russia-gate/">Russia-gate disclosures </a>conflicted with <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/12/05/the-tangled-threads-of-russia-gate/">the original narrative</a> that Putin had somehow set Trump up as a Manchurian candidate. All normal journalistic skepticism was jettisoned. It was as if the Russia-gate advocates started with the conclusion that Trump must go and then made the facts fit into that mold, but anyone who noted the violations of normal investigative procedures was dismissed as a “Trump enabler” or a “Moscow stooge.”</p>
<p><strong>The Text Evidence</strong></p>
<p>But then came the FBI text messages, providing documentary evivdence that key FBI officials involved in the Russia-gate investigation were indeed deeply biased and out to get Trump, adding hard proof to Trump’s longstanding lament that he was the subject of a “witch hunt<strong>.”</strong></p>

</div>
<p>Justified or not, Trump’s feeling of vindication could hardly be more dangerous — particularly at a time when the most urgent need is to drain some testosterone from the self-styled Stable-Genius-in-Chief and his martinet generals.</p>
<p>On the home front, Trump, his wealthy friends, and like-thinkers in Congress may now feel they have an even wider<em> carte blanche</em> to visit untold misery on the poor, the widow, the stranger and other vulnerable humans. That was always an underlying danger of the Resistance’s strategy to seize on whatever weapons were available – no matter how reckless or unfair – to “get Trump.”</p>
<p>Beyond that, Russia-gate has become so central to the Washington establishment’s storyline that there appears to be no room for second-thoughts or turning back. The momentum is such that some Democrats and the media never-Trumpers can’t stop stoking the smoke of Russia-gate and holding out hope against hope that it will somehow justify Trump’s impeachment.</p>
<p>Yet, the sordid process of using legal/investigative means to settle political scores further compromises the principle of the “rule of law” and integrity of journalism in the eyes of many Americans. After a year of Russia-gate, the “rule of law” and “pursuit of truth” appear to have been reduced to high-falutin’ phrases for political score-setttling, a process besmirched by Republicans in earlier pursuits of Democrats and now appearing to be a bipartisan method for punishing political rivals regardless of the lack of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Strzok and Page</strong></p>
<p>Peter Strzok (pronounced “struck”) has an interesting pedigree with multiple tasks regarding both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. As the FBI’s chief of counterespionage during the investigation into then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s unauthorized use of a personal email server for classified information, Strzok reportedly changed the words “grossly negligent” (which could have triggered legal prosecution) to the far less serious “extremely careless” in FBI Director James Comey’s depiction of Clinton’s actions. This semantic shift cleared the way for Comey to conclude just 20 days before the Democratic National Convention began in July 2016, that “no reasonable prosecutor” would bring charges against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
<p>Then, as Deputy Assistant Director of the Counterintelligence Division, Strzok led the FBI’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the U.S. election of 2016. It is a safe bet that he took a strong hand in hand-picking the FBI contingent of analysts that joined “hand-picked” counterparts from CIA and NSA in preparing the evidence-free, Jan. 6, 2017 assessment accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of interfering in the election of 2016. (Although accepted in Establishment groupthink as revealed truth, that poor excuse for analysis reflected the apogee of intelligence politicization — rivaled only by the fraudulent intelligence on “weapons of mass destruction“ in Iraq 15 years ago.)</p>
<p>In June and July 2017 Strzok was the top FBI official working on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, but was taken off that job when the Justice Department IG learned of the Strzok-Page text-message exchange and told Mueller.</p>
<p>There is no little irony in the fact that what did in the FBI sweathearts was their visceral disdain for Mr. Trump, their cheerleading-cum-kid-gloves treatment of Mrs. Clinton and her associates, their 1950-ish, James Clapperesque attitude toward Russians as “almost genetically driven” to evil, and their (Strzok/Page) elitist conviction that they know far better what is good for the country than regular American citizens, including those “deplorables” whom Clinton said made up half of Trump’s supporters.</p>
<p>But Strzok/Page had no idea that their hubris, elitism and scheming would be revealed in so tangible a way. Worst of all for them, the very thing that Strzok, in particular, worked so hard to achieve — the sabotaging of Trump and immunization of Mrs. Clinton and her closest advisers is now coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p><strong>Congress: Oversee? or Overlook?</strong></p>
<p>At this point, the $64 question is whether the various congressional oversight committees will remain ensconced in their customarily cozy role as “overlook” committees, or whether they will have the courage to attempt to carry out their Constitutional duty. The latter course would mean confronting a powerful Deep State and its large toolbox of well-practiced retaliatory techniques, including J. Edgar Hoover-style blackmail on steroids, enabled by electronic surveillance of just about everything and everyone. Yes, today’s technology permits blanket collection, and “Collect Everything” has become the motto.</p>

<p class="wp-caption-text">
</div>
<p>Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, with almost four decades of membership in the House and Senate, openly warned incoming President Trump in January 2017 against criticizing the U.S. intelligence community because U.S. intelligence officials have “six ways from Sunday to get back at you” if you are “dumb” enough to take them on.</p>
<p>Thanks to the almost 10,000 text messages between Strzok and Page, only a small fraction of which were given to Congress four weeks ago, there is now real evidentiary meat on the bones of the suspicions that there indeed was a “deep-state coup” to “correct” the outcome of the 2016 election. We now know that the supposedly apolitical FBI officials had huge political axes to grind. The Strzok-Page exchanges drip with disdain for Trump and those deemed his smelly deplorable supporters. In one text message, Strzok expressed visceral contempt for those working-class Trump voters, writing on Aug. 26, 2016, “Just went to a southern Virginia Walmart. I could SMELL the Trump support. … it’s scary real down here.”</p>
<p>The texts even show Strzok warning of the need for an “insurance policy” to thwart Trump on the off-chance that his poll numbers closed in on those of Mrs. Clinton.</p>
<p>An Aug. 6, 2016 text message, for example, shows Page giving her knight in shining armor strong affirmation: “Maybe you’re meant to stay where you are because you’re meant to protect the country from that menace [Trump].” That text to Strzok includes a link to a David Brooks <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/05/opinion/trumps-enablers-will-finally-have-to-take-a-stand.html">column</a> in The New York Times, in which Brooks concludes with the clarion call: “There comes a time when neutrality and laying low become dishonorable. If you’re not in revolt, you’re in cahoots. When this period and your name are mentioned, decades hence, your grandkids will look away in shame.”</p>
<p>Another text message shows that other senior government officials – alarmed at the possibility of a Trump presidency – joined the discussion. In an apparent reference to an August 2016 meeting with FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Strzok wrote to Page on Aug. 15, 2016, “I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy’s office — that there’s no way he [Trump] gets elected — but I’m afraid we can’t take that risk.”  Strzok added, “It’s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event that you die before you’re 40.”</p>
<p><strong>Insurance Policy?</strong></p>
<p>Senate Judiciary Committee chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, says he will ask Strzok to explain the “insurance policy” when he calls him to testify. What seems already clear is that the celebrated “Steele Dossier” was part of the “insurance,” as was the evidence-less legend that <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/07/24/intel-vets-challenge-russia-hack-evidence/">Russia hacked</a> the DNC’s and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta’s emails and <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/09/20/more-holes-in-russia-gate-narrative/">gave them to WikiLeaks</a>.<a class="image-anchor" href="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1392" src="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal-291x300.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" srcset="https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal-291x300.jpg 291w, https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/fbiseal.jpg 350w" alt="" width="291" height="300" data-lazy-loaded="true" /></a></p>
<p>If congressional investigators have been paying attention, they already know what former weapons inspector Scott Ritter shared with Veteran intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) colleagues this week; namely, that Fusion GPS’s Glenn Simpson, who commissioned the Russia dossier using Democratic Party money, said he reached out to Steele after June 17, just three days before Steele’s <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2017/03/29/the-sleazy-origins-of-russia-gate/">first report was published</a>, drawing on seven sources.</p>
<p>“There is a snowball’s chance in hell that this is raw intelligence gathered by Steele; rather he seems to have drawn on a single ‘trusted intermediary’ to gather unsubstantiated rumor already in existence.”</p>
<p>Another VIPS colleague, Phil Giraldi, writing out of his own experience in private sector consulting, added: “The fact that you do not control your sources frequently means that they will feed you what they think you want to hear. Since they are only doing it for money, the more lurid the details the better, as it increases the apparent value of the information. The private security firm in turn, which is also doing it for the money, will pass on the stories and even embroider them to keep the client happy and to encourage him to come back for more. When I read the Steele dossier it looked awfully familiar to me, like the scores of similar reports I had seen which combined bullshit with enough credible information to make the whole product look respectable.”</p>
<p>It is now widely known that the Democrats ponied up the “insurance premiums,” so to speak, for former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele’s “dossier” of lurid — but largely unproven — “intelligence” on Trump and the Russians. If, as many have concluded, the <strong> </strong> dossier was used to help justify a FISA warrant to snoop on the Trump campaign, those involved will be in deep kimchi, if congressional overseers do their job.</p>
<p>How, you might ask, could Strzok and associates undertake these extra-legal steps with such blithe disregard for the possible consequences should they be caught? The answer is easy; Mrs. Clinton was a shoo-in, remember? This was just extra insurance with no expectation of any “death benefit” ever coming into play — save for Trump’s electoral demise in November 2016. The attitude seemed to be that, if abuse of the FISA law should eventually be discovered — there would be little interest in a serious investigation by the editors of The New York Times and other anti-Trump publications and whatever troubles remained could be handled by President Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, who chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee of Judiciary on Crime and Terrorism, joined Sen. Grassley in signing the letter referring Christopher Steele to the Justice Department to investigate what appear to be false statements about the dossier. In signing, Graham noted the “many stop signs the Department of Justice ignored in its use of the dossier.” The signature of committee ranking member Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, however, was missing — an early sign that a highly partisan battle royale is in the offing.  On Tuesday, Feinstein unilaterally released a voluminous transcript of Glenn Simpson’s earlier testimony and, as though on cue, Establishment pundits portrayed Steele as a good source and Fusion GPS’s Glenn Simpson as a victim.</p>
<p>The Donnybrook is now underway; the outcome uncertain.</p>

						<div class="fusion-text"><p>In this interview with Paul Jay of The Real News Program, Gravel argues that there is no appreciable difference between the Democrat and Republican parties. Both parties are controlled by what we have come to call the 1% –– the small number of billionaires, wealthy families, corporate and banking interests all characterized as Wall Street, which control our culture, society and the polity to include the Congress, the Presidency, the Judiciary and these same institutions at both the state and local levels of government.  </p>
<p>American imperialism executed through our self-appointed role as the world’s policeman is sustained by the military industrial complex (MIC), which profits from wars.  NATO is the globalization of the MIC. </p>
<p>Radical right Republicans are closely aligned with Evangelicals who are interested in wedge issued like abortion and homosexuality. The Democrats are aligned with the Republican neocons and the liberal interventionist. Both groups accept without reservation that the United States is the world’s hegemon and seek to maintain that role through the unrestricted use of our military power. </p>
<p>As concerns individual candidate for public office Gravel makes the case that they are hypocrites. Political candidates tell the people what they want to hear and make promises they know they can’t possibly keep in order to get elected.
